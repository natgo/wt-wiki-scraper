In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium gift rank {{Specs|rank}} Soviet heavy tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced during [[Update 1.67 \"Assault\"]] as a reward for the 2017 World War Two: Chronicle events, unlocked after obtaining 6 Chronicle Awards. This is a British Matilda supplied to the Soviets through the Lend-Lease program whose turret was modified to receive a 76mm cannon.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection.

Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->\n\n'''Armour type:'''\n\n* Cast homogeneous armour (hull front, turret, gun mantlet, cupola, hull sides top -above the tracks-)\n* Rolled homogeneous armour (hull sides bottom -tracks compartment-, hull rear, hull roof, turret roof, cupola roof, gun breech, side skirts).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Both smoke grenades are launched simultaneously in the direction the gun is pointing at, 30 m away from your tank.\n* Smoke shells can also be used as protection but the absence of gun depression will prevent to shoot them close to your vehicle.\n\n=== Mobility ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}\n<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->\n\n{{tankMobility|abMinHp=245|rbMinHp=168}}\n\nOriginally designed as an infantry support, the {{PAGENAME}} is underpowered and sluggish when compared to other tanks at the same battle rating. With a maximum speed of only 23-25 km/h, the {{PAGENAME}} always needs time to get in position and inevitably arrives last.\n\nThe acceleration is good: the maximum speed is reached in seconds. The braking is good as well, as the tank is heavy and the maximum speed poor. The reverse speed is too poor to retreat quickly from an unexpected situation or allow any type of overextend tactic.\n\nWhile the tank weighs only 28.5 tons for heavy tank (that's the average weight of a T-34 at the same BR), its narrow tracks make driving on soft terrain difficult (sand, snow, mud). Turning when moving is good and turning 180° on flat terrain only takes a few seconds. But turning from idling is very slow as there is no neutral steering. This also causes noticeable gun wobbling. Finally, going uphill is always difficult as the {{PAGENAME}} loses speed very quickly.\n\n=== Modifications and economy ===\n{{Specs-Economy}}\n\n== Armaments ==\n{{Specs-Tank-Armaments}}\n=== Main armament ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Weapon|1}}\n<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun. Assess its effectiveness in a battle based on the reloading speed, ballistics and the power of shells. Do not forget about the flexibility of the fire, that is how quickly the cannon can be aimed at the target, open fire on it and aim at another enemy. Add a link to the main article on the gun: <code><nowiki>{{main|Name of the weapon}}</nowiki></code>. Describe in general terms the ammunition available for the main gun. Give advice on how to use them and how to fill the ammunition storage.'' -->\n{{main|F-96 (76 mm)}}\n\nThe gun accuracy starts dropping at 800 m and becomes a handicap over 1000 m. The muzzle velocity is good and offers rather flat trajectories. While the turret rotation speed is good, the poor depression clearly is a handicap: the gun is situated very high due to the profile of the Matilda. This can make targeting an enemy close to you very difficult, especially if there is a little slope putting the enemy tank slightly under your level. The recoil is minimal and does not impact targeting quality. The reload time is a little longer than most of your opponents but the same as any T-34 tank at the same BR. The penetration values are good, like the T-34s.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"100%\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" | [[F-96 (76 mm)|76 mm F-96]] || colspan=\"5\" | Turret rotation speed (°/s) || colspan=\"4\" | Reloading rate (seconds)\n|-\n!

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\n\n;Offensive role\n\nThe {{PAGENAME}} should be played as a support tank like the [[KV-1 (L-11)]], taking advantage of its good armour and good penetration power.\nWhen playing as a support tank, you will help friendly tanks successfully defeat enemy tanks in their frontline engagements. Stay in proximity of the frontline to rely on penetration power, all while staying at a reasonable distance from it to maximize your armour and avoid being flanked or swarmed. Once the enemy push destroyed, you move forward together with frontline tanks and help capturing objectives.\n\nWhen engaging enemy tanks, position your lower glacis behind cover to protect it from incoming fire. Unexperienced players will most likely waste shots on your frontal armour. With the BR-350B (MD-8 fuze) shell, the {{PAGENAME}} easily can take on most opponents at this BR.\n\n;Defensive role\n\nIn the event the spearhead tanks of your team get crushed by the enemy, you will then play a defensive role by containing enemy breakthrough attempts.\nIt will fall upon you to stop enemy tanks dead in their tracks. Being at a distance from the frontline will force enemy tanks to drive in the open to get to you. Always play with a nearby obstacle you can use as cover if you get hit and need to repair. Have a planned escape plan as the enemy will try to use artillery or CAS to dislodge you from cover.\nA good player in a {{PAGENAME}} can lock a side of the battlefield, especially in corridor maps.\n\n;Other roles\n\nIf you try to use the {{PAGENAME}} in a different role on the battlefield, you will quickly reach its limits:\n\n* If you try to play the {{PAGENAME}} as a frontline tank, you will suffer from the tank's poor mobility and be easily flanked by light tanks or armored cars and, especially if they swarm you. Your turning speed is too poor to manoeuvre quickly and your reverse speed is too poor to get out of hot spots quickly.\n* If you attempt to play long range engagements, your gun will lack accuracy and penetration will drop over distance, while your silhouette will make you a target of choice for enemy counterfire. The absence of gun depression will prevent you from firing behind the cover of a ridge.\n\n;Notable enemies:\n\nYour worst enemies will be the ones equipped with long cannons, able to penetrate you easily from middle to long range.\n\n* Tank destroyers: M10 GMC, Archer, 90/53 M41M, Na-To, Pvkv II, Pvkv m/43 (1946).\n* Frontline tanks: M4, Pz. IV F2, T-34s, Chi-Nu.\n\n;Defeating a {{PAGENAME}}\n\nThe {{PAGENAME}} has a pretty strong hull and turret armour but several weak spots exist:\n\n* In a frontal encounter, the gun breech is the easiest to target (under the gun). The sides of the lower glacis are also extremely weak (20mm).\n* If you have a very high penetrating power, aim for the turret: a successful penetration will most likely knock out 3 out of 4 crew members.\n* When flanking, aim for the turret ring (small area).\n\nIn case of a frontal attack, try blinding the {{PAGENAME}} with smoke and then swarm it with several fast tanks to saturate its defensive capacities. If you are alone, flanking a {{PAGENAME}} undetected remains your best chance to destroy it.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness.

Avoid using categorical definitions such as \"bad\", \"good\" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as \"inadequate\" and \"effective\".'' -->\n\n'''Pros:'''\n\n* Strong armour, comparable to the KV-1s. Especially sturdy against SPAAs like [[Wirbelwind]]\n* Gun with sufficient penetration to oppose enemies like [[M4A1]], [[Chi-Nu]].\n* Quick turret rotation for a heavy tank.\n* Spherical gun mantlet can bounce some poorly-aimed shells\n\n'''Cons:'''\n\n* Poor mobility: slow (25 km/h max) especially on mountainous terrain, and can't outflank others.\n* Extremely insufficient -2° gun depression, is only enough for flat urban combat.\n* Average survivability against experienced tankers. Frontal weak spots lead to the 3 crew members in small turret\n* -4 km/h reverse is too slow to get the tank out from danger\n\n== History ==\n<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction.

The Red Army received a third of the Matildas produced overall. Matilda heavy tanks were appreciated by the Soviet tank crews for their strong armour. A notable weak point of the tank however was its poor performance in snowy or icy conditions because of its narrow tracks.\n\n;Upgunning attempt\n\nWhile the Red Army used the standard 2-pounder gun installed on Matildas from the beginning, the evolution of German armour made this gun less and less effective. In December 1941, plans were made to equip Matildas with the 76 mm of the KV-1. Only 1 prototype was built. Installing a 76 mm gun in an already cramped turret without modifying it brought major shortcomings: the quasi-absence of gun depression and the even more limited space for loaders to operate around the gun. This led the Red Army to scrap the project and concentrate on new KV-1 models instead.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?q=%23matilda_f96 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|F_WdjadFKp4|'''Matilda Mk II F-96 Tank Review''' - ''NUSensei''|eQpmnqi82gA|'''Matilda Mk II F-96: Is it worth it?''' - ''Many Miles Away''|eYcfCbaIJqc|'''I've Received The Matilda Mk.II F-96!
