If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\n\nWhen playing the Magach 6, try not to be at the frontlines of the battle too often and instead, stay a bit farther back, supporting your teammates that are on the frontline or provide flanking cover, where the enemy will least expect you to be. Make sure to move from cover to cover if possible, and hide behind hills to reduce the likelihood of being shot at. The Magach 6 is quite a tall tank and can be easily spotted moving across terrain. Equipped with the 105 mm M68 cannon, the Magach 6 can damage any tank. Usually your main shell will be APDS, as it offers the best overall performance, though HEATFS does offer more penetration but has its own set of disadvantages. \n\nIf on a map with close quarters battles/urban environments, try to stay away from confined spaces, and stay on the flanks to find a position where ambushing enemies are possible. Be aware that most light tanks and certain medium tanks/MBTs can get to a position before you as they have better mobility than you. If you prefer being near the epicentre of the battle, hang back a bit and support your teammates from the rear, and guard their flanks if needed. Your armour at very close range is usually negated, and while you can shrug off a few AP rounds, medium and heavy tanks can still aim at your weak spots and put you out of combat. Try to have an ally nearby if aiming for an objective to reduce the chances of you being surprised/flanked. Be aware of lightly-armoured vehicles such as BMPs or the R3 T106, as the Magach 6 does not have a .50 cal HMG to gun them down, and will require you to time your shots correctly. HEATFS or HESH would be the best to knock out these light tanks, especially with HESH being able to overpressure light tanks.\n\nWith the Magach 6 lacking a HMG, it will be hard to shoot down air targets with only 3 x 7.62 mm machine guns. \n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness.

Avoid using categorical definitions such as \"bad\", \"good\" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as \"inadequate\" and \"effective\".'' -->'''Pros:'''\n\n* Great protection from the front hull against most solid AP rounds.\n* Good mobility \n* Great handling and turning manoeuvres \n* Good gun handling\n* Great gun at its tier\n\n'''Cons:'''\n\n* No .50 cal HMG to kill lightly-armoured vehicles or low-flying aircraft\n* Turret mantlet isn't heavily armoured and can be penetrated easily\n* Turret ring is a noticeable weak spot\n* Vulnerable to HEATFS and APDS shells\n* Cupola is a weak spot and APHE can knock out your turret crew\n\n== History ==\n<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction.
