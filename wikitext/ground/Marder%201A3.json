Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members.

If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' The text within these arrows are not to be deleted -->\nThe Marder 1A3's armour is minimal, even if a bit better than its predecessor's. Any calibre larger than light machine guns (7.62 mm) can penetrate the vehicle.
