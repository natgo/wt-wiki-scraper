In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium gift rank {{Specs|rank}} British heavy tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced during [[Update \"New Power\"]] as a reward for [[Battle Pass: Season I]].\n\nThe Matilda Hedgehog is an Australian late-war experiment of the early but legendary Matilda infantry tank. The most notable difference from other Matildas is the presence of a new type of armament in the rear; a Spigot system fitted with Hedgehog mortars. This mortar was commonly used in naval warfare as an anti-submarine weapon and as such is very lethal weaponry if used correctly against tanks.\n\nOne of the flaws of the Matilda Hedgehog over other variants is the reduced combat readiness and versatility. This is because the Hedgehog mortar is a situational and limited weapon in tank warfare. The vehicle also loses defensive equipment as the smoke grenade launchers and receives a large weak spot in its rear, since the Hedgehog launcher acts as a large unprotected ammo rack.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->\nThe uneven and sloped armour protection is generally useful versus most low to medium calibre (40-75 mm) guns in the rank; the farther from the target makes it better for the armour. The irregular front and sloped side armour configuration on the turret makes it perfect to bounce some poorly aimed shots, yet some areas are not sloped at all and can be easily penetrated by shells of over 80 mm of penetration in close ranges. This armour has not changed drastically since the Matilda III, however, some noteworthy areas did receive an increase in protection: the turret ring received an additional armour plate of 40 mm. Extended from the front to the sides and partially reaching the back of the turret ring area. Effectively concealing a good portion of the previously vulnerable turret ring. This armour acts also as spaced armour since the shell needs to penetrate the first plate and then will likely shatter before colliding with the turret ring armour. Flanking tanks like the [[Sd.Kfz.234/2]] will be troubled when firing at this area from the sides or the rear, yet will be easier to just penetrate the turret side armour. Anti-tank assault guns like the [[StuG III F]] will struggle equally when firing at the turret ring. The area under the gun mantlet remains only protected with a sloped armour prone to bounce shells.\n\nThe commander cupola has been lowered. This reduces effectively the previously noticeable large weak spot on the turret of the Matilda III. While the 75 mm of armour remains unchanged, the flatter cupola is difficult to penetrate.\n\nAside from these changes, minor structural armour has been added as fenders and the structure for the Hedgehog mortar system in the rear. This armour is barely effective in countering armour-piercing shells, and might just protect versus powerful HE shells as those on the [[15cm sIG 33 B Sfl]].\n\n{{Notice|Increasing the \"Vitality\" feature of the tank crew can increase survivability against spalling and shrapnel.}}\n\n'''Armour type:''' <!-- The types of armour present on the vehicle and their general locations -->\n<!-- Example: * Rolled homogeneous armour (Front, Side, Rear, Hull roof)\n* Cast homogeneous armour (Turret, Transmission area) -->\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->\n\n{{tankMobility|abMinHp=294|rbMinHp=168}}\nWith a rounded heavyweight of over 27 tons, the Matilda isn't the fastest vehicle, but one of the heaviest. However, the tank has a double Leyland diesel powerplant that provides 190 HP and is just enough to boost the tank through regular terrain. Maps with lots of slopes and rocks will be difficult to overcome because of the outpowered engine; is best to avoid intricate shortcuts since if stuck, the Matilda won't be able to get out - Maps like [[Karelia (Ground Forces)|Karelia]] or [[Stalingrad (Ground Forces)|Stalingrad Factory]].\n\nFortunately because of the weight, in flat ground, the vehicle keeps a lot of traction and can reach top speed in approximately 17 seconds. This slow top speed suits Matilda's gun stabilization, effectively firing on the move while on cruise gear 1. As most British tanks on the rank, the reverse leaves a lot to desire. Still, the lack of any smoke cover means using the reverse gearbox is the only way to effectively retreat from frontal engagements without angling. The sluggish nature of the Matilda also sets up the tank for ambushes. \n\n=== Modifications and economy ===\n{{Specs-Economy}}\n\n== Armaments ==\n{{Specs-Tank-Armaments}}\n=== Main armament ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Weapon|2}}\n<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun.

The also decent penetration values and ballistics make Matilda a capable heavy tank in frontal engagements. Despite the effectiveness of the gun, the small calibre will usually require a follow-up shot to knock out a tank. \n\nThe recommended ammunition is the Shot Mk.IXB APCBC/T. Because of the overall better penetration values and ballistics. With the auxiliary ammo being either the Shell Mk.2 or the Shell Mk.1 AP/T to counter light targets as anti-air trucks or exposed crew, which are quite common at the rank.\n \n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"100%\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" | [[QF 2-pounder (40 mm)|40 mm QF 2-pounder]] || colspan=\"5\" | Turret rotation speed (°/s) || colspan=\"4\" | Reloading rate (seconds)\n|-\n!

If there is no additional weaponry remove this subsection.'' -->\n{{main|Hedgehog}}\nBaptized by its name, the Matilda Hedgehog features an experimental spigot mortar system launching Hedgehog depth charges. These mortars can be widely found in ships like the [[Town (L45)|Town class]] because they were designed for anti-submarine warfare. \n\nThe Hedgehog mortar now placed behind the Matilda offers lethal explosive ordnance. Yet the death from above by the Hedgehog will be challenging to accomplish. Firstly, the Hedgehog is ''only effective in a default distance of 190 m or less''. The launcher can be raised by aiming upward, lowering the horizontal distance the mortar will travel from the tank. Secondly, the mortars will be launched individually from right to left. Yet they will fall quite close to each other. Depending on the intentions of the player, they might turn the hull while deploying the Hedgehog, to spread the fire.  Lastly, there is available a limited number of mortars (7) and the eventual reload of more inside a capture point will be tediously slow and dangerous. This means the mortar is likely to be a piece of single-use equipment. The mortar rack is also poorly shielded and vulnerable to machine gunfire. If hit, the mortars will likely detonate and disable all of them. \n\nIn more positive regards, a single hit of the mortar atop enemy tanks will be destructive. Acting as a small bomb, the mortar will be effective versus light or unarmoured vehicles as half-tracks and open-top vehicles. Armour thickness will not be an issue, since the 80 mm of penetration are enough to take down most tanks in the rank. \n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"4\" | [[Hedgehog]]\n|-\n!

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\nMatilda should be played as a support tank. While is unlike to be the first tank in the line, Matilda Hedgehog should advance to take place in the vanguard or rearguard of the joint attacking force. Pushing slowly towards the enemy positions with support from team members; halt or reduce the speed to fire at any target that reveals itself. When moving and firing with the stabilizer, Matilda's armour weakness is not only harder to pinpoint, but more prone to bouncing shells. Additionally, players should keep in mind the importance of smart positioning and proximity to allies since if ambushed by the sides or the rear, the Matilda will likely be eliminated. \n\nWhen defending, find distance away from choke points near vital areas and blast enemies as they try to enter; the excellent depression will be handy during these defensive stances. Procure to keep a safe distance from the enemy to maximise the effectiveness of the armour so Matilda will be very hard to destroy.\n\nClose-distance fighting is ill-advised and tricky as opponents will be able to easily penetrate the front armour or find those weak points; such as the loaded Hedgehog mortar rack in the rear. Therefore, open and vast maps are the forte for Matilda's armour and main gun. Although this is contradictory to the novelty of this variant: the Hedgehog mortar. \n\nConsidering the launching range of the Hedgehog is quite limited, a possible tactic to deliver a mortar rain more effectively is to reach capture zones within 190 m away then fire the mortars if the enemy is in the vicinity or inside the perimeter of the zone. This is effective on urban maps like [[Eastern Europe (Ground Forces)|Eastern Europe]] and [[Berlin (Ground Forces)|Berlin]], but on vast areas as those on maps like [[Maginot Line (Ground Forces)|Maginot]], the Hedgehog becomes quite ineffective. \n\nPlayers should decide depending on the map if it is reasonable and useful to load the Hedgehog mortars. Also acknowledging the very capable 40 mm QF gun remains the principal weapon.\n\n=== Enemies worth noting ===\nOpponents that deserve extra attention are the tank destroyers. Most tank destroyers at the rank were designed exactly to counter the heavy frontal armour of tanks like the Matilda. \n\n==== Germany ▀ ====\nThe two German Marders carry a gun that can easily knock you out at long range, especially the [[Marder III H|Marder III (H)]], but those have thin armour, so use that to your advantage. The more armoured German TD, the StuG III, is even more dangerous. The [[StuG III A]] carry the [[KwK 37 (75 mm)|short 75 mm]] that can fire high-penetrating HEAT rounds while its front armour can resist the 2-pounder's shots from a longer distance. The [[StuG III F]] is a bigger problem with its [[KwK 40 (75 mm)|longer 75 mm gun]] and thicker armour, but its high battle rating of 3.7 should make this an uncommon sight. The Matilda will have a hard time fighting the StuGs due to the front armour and inability to manoeuvre to hit the side armour, thus it would be better to leave that to more manoeuvrable team members.\n\n==== Medium tanks ====\nOther tanks to worry about are the more common medium tanks each nation carries from the [[M4A1|M4 Shermans]], [[Pz.IV F2|Panzer IVs]], and [[T-34 (1941)|T-34s]]. These medium tanks have frontal armour able to resist Matilda's 2-pounder rounds and easily outmanoeuvre it as well. The most noteworthy tank to worry about is the Panzer IV with the [[KwK 40 (75 mm)|long 75 mm guns]], which can easily destroy your frontal armour.\n\n=== Counter tactics ===\nUnlike Matilda III, this tank has a Hedgehog 183 mm launcher on its back. While it can be useful against clusters of unmoving vehicles, it is inaccurate and takes time or skills to get used to. It also makes the Matilda Hedgehog much more vulnerable to flanking attacks since the backwards firing arc of the 40 mm gun is now limited and blinded by the mortar structure.  \n\nThe launcher can be shot easily and results in an ammo rack explosion, possibly getting the tank destroyed even by SPAA vehicles or more commonly, burning off most Hedgehog mortars. If impossible to flank, an easy area to target is the thin armour located on each extremity of the lower front glacis (on either side of the driver's position).\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness.
