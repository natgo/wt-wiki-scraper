In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' ({{Annotation|試製七糎半対戦車自走砲「ナト」|Shisei-Nana-Senchimētoru Hantai-Sensha Jisōhō [Na-To]}}) is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Japanese tank destroyer {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced along with the initial Japanese Ground Forces tree in [[Update 1.65 \"Way of the Samurai\"]].\n\nThe Type 5 Na-To is a rather traditional tank destroyer of a simple vehicle chassis with a gun pasted on top. It is highly vulnerable to many battlefield weapons due to its weak overall armour, but if it can get the jump on an enemy, it can wreck havoc. Thus, one should not play the Na-To as a front-line weapon but as a sniper far back behind the front lines. This will ensure the Na-To will not become a priority target and also to maximize the gun's long-range capacity to take out targets. Watch frequently traveled roads and choke points for enemy, then blast them away before retreating to reload in case they are still active after the first shot.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection.

Assuming it is not upped by another vehicle in the line-up with a higher BR, the worst heavy tank the Na-To could face are the Soviet [[KV-1S]] and British [[Churchill Mk III]], both with front armour easily penetrable by the Na-To's 75 mm gun at standard ranges without taking angling into consideration. However, the thin armour of the Na-To does mean that any tank it faces could defeat the Na-To, so always get the first shot off at the enemy.\n\nPlaying the Na-To as a sniper support from a long distance from the front-line will provide the Na-To increased survivability and also potentially more targets to aim at than with its limited traverse arc up close. If long range is not possible, keep the Na-To stationed at a cover's corner watching an enemy's frequented area. As soon as one shows up, blast away before retreating to cover.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness.

It used a 75 mm tank gun, known as the Type I 75 mm. This was a lighter version of the Type II 75 mm tank gun used by the Chi-To and Chi-Ri.\n\nThe Na-To had two prototypes, known simply as the Na-To I and Na-To II. The Na-To I used a variant of the Type I 75 mm gun known as the \"Type 1 75 mm Model I\". The Na-To II used the Type I 75 mm Model II.\n\nFollowing trials, the Na-To II was selected over the Na-To I to be mass-produced. An order was placed for 200 vehicles to be made, but by the end of the war only 70 of them were started, with none reaching completion.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=jp_type_5_na_to Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n== See also ==\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wikipedia:Type_5_Na-To|[Wikipedia] Type 5 Na-To]]\n\n{{Japan tank destroyers}}"}}
