In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' (\"Rhinoceros\") is a rank {{Specs|rank}} German tank destroyer {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.57 \"Battle March\"]]. It was developed as an interim solution to deal with Soviet heavy tanks on the Eastern front who were immune to the guns of Marders. It consists of an 88 mm anti-tank gun PaK 43 mounted on a Panzer IV chassis. It is also known as the \"Hornet\" (\"Hornisse\" in German).\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->\n'''Armour type:'''\n\n* Rolled homogeneous armour (hull, gun shield, superstructure)\n* Structural steel (gun breech, mudguards)\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

And, the vehicle can be knocked out with overpressure from high-calibre HE rounds. The {{PAGENAME}} also lacks roof protection, making it a very desirable target for enemy fighters and attackers. Stay behind cover to avoid strafing runs or rocket attacks. One interesting (and somewhat comical) note on the {{PAGENAME}}'s armour is that being so thin, high-penetration shells may pass through it without detonating at all.\n\n=== Mobility ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}\n<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->\n\n{{tankMobility|abMinHp=426|rbMinHp=265}}\n\nBeing based on the chassis of the Panzer IV, the {{PAGENAME}} benefits from the same all-round mobility: the tank accelerates and brakes quickly and is able to reach its max speed of 43 km/h in a dozen of seconds. While there is no neutral steering, turning on the spot is still easily done as it is a light vehicle. The reverse speed is average and won't let you back quickly from a dangerous situation. If you need to quickly turn your hull on the spot towards flanking enemies, privilege the reverse gear as it has more torque. The offroad mobility is good: the {{PAGENAME}} can reach 12 km/h when climbing uphill from idling and 15 km/h when fording. The \"Ostketten\" wide tracks for snowy terrain also offer an improved offroad handling. Only big obstacles will hinder your mobility (large trees, concrete blocks, parked vehicles). In short, the {{PAGENAME}}'s mobility is good enough for the role it fulfills.\n\n=== Modifications and economy ===\n{{Specs-Economy}}\n\n== Armaments ==\n{{Specs-Tank-Armaments}}\n=== Main armament ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Weapon|1}}\n<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun.

Since they are secondary weapons, there are no ammunition belt options. Furthermore, they have various blind spots (e.g. the rear and the front of the tank and the area above the vehicle). The machine guns have an elevation of only +15°, rendering them useless against diving fighters or bombers.\n\n== Usage in battles ==\n<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics.

The 88 mm PaK 43 gun has great penetration an great destructive power. It can destroy most opponents in one shot, and is an all-around great gun. Reload times are average. The best way to use this gun is in a sniping position, firing from behind a ridgeline or from behind cover. However, the Nashorn has bad gun depression, which can make ridgeline firing sometimes dangerous.\n\nAt close ranges, the Nashorn loses much of its effectiveness since it lacks a traversable turret and has poor survivability.\n\nSpeaking of, this vehicle's armour is very thin. It will not protect internal components from heavy-calibre machine gun fire, and it certainly can't defend against full-calibre tank shells. Sometimes, high-penetration shells will overpenetrate and pass through the vehicle without detonating, but this should not be counted on. Most of the time, any hit that connects will do great damage to the tank. Additionally, this vehicle has a large silhouette and can be destroyed by largecalibre HE rounds. Even worse, the Nashorn is open-topped, which means that artillery is a significant threat. Enemy planes will also see the Nashorn as a highly desirable target, since strafing runs can cripple or destroy the vehicle. The Nashorn has no way of defending against this. It is equipped with machine guns, but they do not have enough elevation to fire at planes. To avoid artillery and fire from planes, stay behind cover: shrubbery and buildings work well for this.\n\nAs a sniping-based tank destroyer, the Nashorn's mobility is not its most important feature. Still, it's nice that the vehicle has good mobility all around. The tank accelerates and brakes quickly and is able to reach its max speed of 43 km/h in normal gameplay. While there is no neutral steering, turning on the spot is still easily done as it is a light vehicle. (Even so, the lack of a turret means that flankers are still very deadly. Watch out for them.) The reverse speed is average and won't let you back quickly from a dangerous situation. (This is important to note when peeking out from behind cover to take a shot.) Thanks to its good mobility, the Nashorn is able to reach sniping positions in a reasonable amount of time or to relocate mid-game if necessary.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness.

This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->\n\n===Design===\nIn 1942, the German tank destroyers equipped with 75 mm guns (Marder & StuG IIIs) became ineffective following the arrival of uparmoured Soviet KV heavy tanks on the Eastern front. To quickly answer that situation, the German command mandated an interim vehicle to be proposed before the arrival of a properly designed heavy Panzerjäger. The interim solution was to rely upon the newly developed anti-tank cannons whose caliber had proven very effective even against heavily armoured targets.\n\n===Development===\nThe firm Alkett in charge of producing Pz.III and StuG III quickly proposed the Nashorn, born of the assembly of an anti-tank gun and a turretless tank chassis. An anti-tank 88 mm PaK 43 cannon was installed on a Panzer IV chassis and a superstructure built around the rear of the vehicle to provide a protected crew compartment. The engine was then moved from the rear to the central section of the chassis: the drive train of a Panzer III was used to achieve the result. The newly created Panzerjäger provided the devastating firepower of an anti-tank gun with the good mobility of a medium tank. The protection was however lacking, as it was a stop-gap vehicle. Parallel to the Nashorn equipped with an AT gun, the firm Alkett  proposed the Hummel on the same chassis but equipped with a 150 mm howitzer.\nThe Nashorn was approved by the German command and entered production in 1943. 494 vehicles in total were built from 1943 to 1945.\n\n===Combat usage===\nThe Nashorn first saw combat at the battle of Kursk in 1943.\nIt served mainly on the Eastern front in heavy tank destroyer battalions (\"Schwere Panzerjäger-Abteilungen\") and proved deadly in the Eastern flat steppes. It was also used in Italy to a lesser extent but did not achieve the same combat performance due to the relief and lack of visibility.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=germ_panzerjager_nashorn Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|rJW2KyvSjSE|'''Nashorn Tank Review''' - ''NUSensei''}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n;Vehicles equipped with the same chassis\n* [[Pz.IV_(Family)|Pz.IV]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wt:en/devblog/current/877|[Devblog] Nashorn: the German 'Rhinoceros']]\n* [[wikipedia:Nashorn|[Wikipedia] Nashorn]]\n* [https://tanks-encyclopedia.com/ww2/nazi_germany/Sd-Kfz-164_Nashorn.php <nowiki>[Tanks Encyclopedia]</nowiki> 8.8 cm PaK 43/1 auf Fgst.Pz.Kpfw III und IV (Sf) Sd.Kfz. 164 \"Nashorn\"]\n\n{{Germany tank destroyers}}"}}
