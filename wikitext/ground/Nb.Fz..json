The armour thickness is actually rather thin, despite a very imposing look and a complex internal layout. It has six crew members: a driver, two machine gunners in small independent turrets, a gunner, a loader, and a commander in the main turret where both main guns are located. The front armour thickness ranges from just 13 mm to 20 mm, making it possible to immobilize it with heavy machine gun fire frontally.\n\n=== Mobility ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}\n<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->\n\n{{tankMobility|abMinHp=434|rbMinHp=248}}\n\nThe top speed of the {{PAGENAME}} is 28.5 km/h, which is slow for low-tier ranks. The power-to-weight ratio, on the other hand, is rather good at 11.9 hp/ton, giving it a very nice acceleration considering how large it is. But, this is relatively slow, so remember to stay in cover, because tank destroyers can destroy this vehicle's armour relatively quickly and easily. Another thing to keep in mind is the Neubaufahrzeug's terrible rotation. Pivoting on the spot is basically impossible, and it slows down a lot in turns. Be careful not to turn too much, or you will slow down and be an easy target.\n\n=== Modifications and economy ===\n{{Specs-Economy}}\n\n== Armaments ==\n{{Specs-Tank-Armaments}}\n=== Main armament ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Weapon|1}}\n<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun.

Problem is, due to the current limitations of the game, it is impossible to take more than four different kinds of shells, and for multi-gun tanks, each gun can just pick two shells in its repertoire. So the practical combinations would be either APHE+HEAT, APHE+smoke, or HEAT+smoke.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"100%\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" | [[KwK37 (75 mm)|75 mm KwK37]] || colspan=\"5\" | Turret rotation speed (°/s) || colspan=\"4\" | Reloading rate (seconds)\n|-\n!

APCBC to deal with light and medium tanks, ~8 shots of Hl.Gr 38B HEAT for heavy tanks.  \n* 37 mm gun: Bring ~20 rounds of PzGr APHE for lightly armoured targets, and ~20 shots of PzGr 40 APCR for medium and heavy targets.  \n\n'''In general:''' \n\nThe {{PAGENAME}} is a tank much too big for its own good. The profile of the {{PAGENAME}} is very similar to the Soviet [[T-28]]. However, the armour of the {{PAGENAME}} is much too thin with the majority of the armour on the tank being 13 mm, even large sections of the front armour are this thickness. There certainly are lots of space inside between modules that there is a chance for a shell to pass through without causing significant damage. However, it is very easy for the enemy to target the main turret and knock out the necessary crew members to incapacitate the {{PAGENAME}}'s fighting ability, leading to follow-up movement for the enemy to close in to destroy the {{PAGENAME}}. As such, the {{PAGENAME}}'s imposing size is a paper tiger and should not imbue a player with the impression of a typical medium tank as even a 20 mm autocannon shell will easily tear apart the {{PAGENAME}}\n\n'''Fire support:'''\n\nThe {{PAGENAME}}'s armour attribute relegates it to a support or ambush role that makes the most of the terrain for cover. Though the turret is mounted tall and is rather vulnerable to return fire, the tandem 75 mm and 37 mm gun on the same mantlet gives the {{PAGENAME}} several benefits when fighting from an emplaced position. Firstly, the gun elevation and depression angles are rather good so taking a position behind a hill to hide the hull while only exposing the turret is more feasible. Second, the manner the guns are mounted means that quick follow-up shots with little adjustments with the turret is possible, especially when changing optics with the weapon selection controls (\"Select Primary Weapon\" and \"Select Secondary Weapon\" in the controls). Thirdly, the fast reload speeds of about 3.5 seconds between the two guns means rapid firing rounds down a beaten zone is possible the {{PAGENAME}}, possible denying an avenue of advance to the enemy if the {{PAGENAME}} can lockdown an area from its position. With a ''Hl.Gr 38B'' HEAT round available for the 75 mm, the {{PAGENAME}} can plink through even the fearsome [[B1 bis]] from the front.\n\nSince the turret is located near the front of the hull, the Nb.Fz. can comfortable peek out the front half only. By binding separate keys for firing the 75 mm and 37 mm guns, you can \"one-two-punch\" almost any tank you encounter such as [[Crusader (Family)|Crusader]], [[T-70]], [[Chi-Ha (Family)|Chi-Ha]], [[M3A1 Stuart|M3A1]], etc. It is recommended to fire a similar type of ammunition across both guns to ensure unity in damage and penetration, for example use the 37 mm APHE and 75 mm APCBC for lighter opponents, and 37 mm APCR and 75 mm HEAT against heavier tanks. When engaging enemies, you can fire the 75 mm first because it has better damage, then go after any still-conscious crew with the 37 mm while the 75 mm reloads. The Nb.Fz. can fire quick salvos thanks to the fast reload of its cannons. \n\nLuckily, the Nb.Fz. has adequate speed to keep up with medium tank teammates, allowing it to provide supporting fire in time. When moving, only do so to another cover that the {{PAGENAME}} can fight from. Do not expose the {{PAGENAME}} in the open as even heavy machine gun fire from a distance can penetrate the 13 mm armour plating on the sides, rear, and even the front at certain angles. Though the {{PAGENAME}} has the benefit of having a rather large volume of space inside for dead air, the engine takes a pretty large place in the tank that is easily destroyed from the side. If this immobilizes the {{PAGENAME}}, it could spell a quick end pretty soon by follow-up enemy shots or incoming air attacks. Air attacks can also quickly destroy the {{PAGENAME}} if any planes with armaments larger than 12.7 mm come and strafe the {{PAGENAME}}.\n\nUnfortunately, most enemy tanks can knock out the {{PAGENAME}} with relative ease once it gets a shot in. Some significant worries the {{PAGENAME}} should be aware of are enemy heavy tanks and speedy vehicles carrying autocannons. Enemy heavy tanks like the [[B1 ter]] can be a big issue as none of the {{PAGENAME}}'s armaments, not even at close range, can reliably penetrate from the front (the B1 bis has slightly thinner armour that is easier to penetrate). \n\nIn the {{PAGENAME}}, avoid engaging in direct combat. Find a good terrain to cover the {{PAGENAME}} and use the tall turret and gun elevation angles to strike the enemy as they attempt to attack the point. Choose positions where you only need to deal with threats from one direction, as the Nb.Fz's slow turret rotation does not allow it to respond to targets around it fast enough which can be dangerous. For example, a straight street can be suitable, wheras an open field may not be. \n\n'''Twin cannon tactic:'''\n\nThe {{PAGENAME}}'s dual cannon design brings another interesting tactic: in a standoff between you and another enemy behind cover, both of you may be hesitant to leave the cover in fear of being shot first, with the hope that one would fire their cannon first then the other will pounce during the reload process. This type of situation can last for quite a while with conventional tanks. However, with the {{PAGENAME}}, this can be exploited to your advantage. Turn the {{PAGENAME}}'s turret slightly so it is visible for the enemy, then deliberately fire the 37 mm towards their general direction. Thinking that the {{PAGENAME}} has fired and missed its shot, most opponents will peek out and return fire thinking that you are still reloading. Once they move and expose themselves, use the ready 75 mm gun and blast them away with either a HEAT or APCBC depending on the opponent's model. This tactic will work even better if the Nb.Fz. is covered with bushes to conceal its twin cannons. \n\n=== Enemies worth noting: ===\n\n* [[B1 bis|B1]]: The HEAT shell for the 75 mm can generally be adequate against the B1 bis. If the B1 bis is angling, target its turret ring or copula to disable its 47 mm gunner, make sure to use 75 mm HEAT and 37 mm APCR. Use the same ammo if you get to shoot the B1 bis's side or rear. Against a B1 ter, target the copula with APHE/APCBC so the shrapnel can travel downwards and knock out the 47 mm gunner. Unfortunately the 75 mm HEAT and 37 mm APCR will be largely ineffective when shooting its hull side, so target its hull rear or turret sides and rear. \n* [[Valentine I|Valentine Mk I]]: The Valentine I is a bit easier to penetrate as its armour is 60 mm compared to the B1's ~70 mm, but it has a much stronger 40 mm gun which you should avoid at all costs. Ammo from both of your cannons don't perform that much better against it, since experienced Valentine commanders will angle. Still you can target its turret front with HEAT/APCR. Knocking out the 2 crew inside its turret will destroy it as that's 2/3 of its crew. Concisely, as an early war tank, just avoid these heavy vehicles where possible and call for stronger teammates to help.\n* SPAAG: Fast vehicles with autocannons, mostly self-propelled anti-aircraft guns, are also a concern as the autocannon can easily chew up the {{PAGENAME}} once they begin firing on it. Some examples are [[AS 42]] and [[Flakpanzer 38]]. Although the {{PAGENAME}} has a typically faster turret traverse speed than the other contemporary German medium tanks, its not a big enough improvement to track a flanking vehicle should it catch the {{PAGENAME}} off guard.\n\n=== Against the Nb.Fz: ===\n\n* '''Light tanks & SPAAs''': Light vehicles like [[M2A4]], [[A13 (Family)|A13]], [[BT-5]], etc should use their superior speed and manoeuvrability to their advantage, and flank the Nb.Fz. The Nb.Fz. has slow hull traverse, substandard turret rotation for all turrets, and sluggish acceleration, meaning it cannot deal with your surprise attack quickly and is certain to take damage. In a flank, destroy its driver or engine first so it cannot move, then wipe out its turret crew. No need to worry about it returning fire as its turret will never complete a 90° turn before you load your second shell/clip. However, if it happens to face you, shoot the right side of its main turret to knock out its gunner, then go for the rest of the crew. Never get hit by it though, as its cannons can fire explosive APHE/APHEBC or piercing APCR/HEAT which are all fatal for your light vehicle. \n* '''Medium tanks & tank destroyers''': Medium tanks loses the advantage of fast speed meaning they cannot flank as effectively, while tank destroyers are usually turretless, armed with medium-tank-level cannons, and have similar mobility as medium tanks. Now, since flanking happens less and direct engagement rate increases, you should aim for the right side of its main turret to disarm it. Only peek out and fire when the Nb.Fz. is distracted. If it misses a shot, do not go out immediately since it probably has another cannon loaded, waiting for you to take the bait. Thus, it is better to act defensively and wait for the Nb.Fz. to make mistakes first, such as shifting its focus to another teammate. For open-top tank destroyers, relocate immediately if the Nb.Fz. drops an artillery strike on you. \n* '''Heavy tanks''': Well-protected tanks (e.g. [[Valentine I]], [[B1 bis]]) can only face the Nb.Fz. in a full downtier. Thanks to the thick armour on these tanks you can comfortably take its blows. However you still need to angle or swing your turret randomly to increase your effective thickness as well as to throw off the Nb.Fz.'s aim. It has a maximum penetration of 80 mm which might go through your weak spot, but can be easily surpassed by angling constantly. \n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness.

Historically, they were slow, heavy, and complicated. Not thought of as successful, only 5 were actually built. 3 of these tanks were sent to Norway at the start of the war, but only 1 of the 3 saw action. They were mostly used for propaganda.\n\n=== In-game description ===\nAn experimental multi-turret medium tank. The first models were built in 1934. During construction the tank took on the designation of Neubaufahrzeug V (Nb.Fz.V) for the first two vehicles. The second series of three tanks had the designation Nb.Fz.VI.\n\nIn German military documentation the designation Panzerkampfwagen VII is also encountered; it was later replaced by Pz.Kpfw.IVnA (Panzerkampfwagen IV new Art). During the Norwegian campaign the tanks were also referred to in documents as Neubau-Pz.Kpfw.IV.\n\nAll three tanks of the second series were used during the Norwegian operation.
