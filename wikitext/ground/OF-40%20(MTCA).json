In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium gift rank {{Specs|rank}} Italian medium tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.89 \"Imperial Navy\"]] as a [[wt:en/news/6201-shop-of-40-mk-2-mtca-pre-order-en|premium pack]] in the Gaijin store. It was removed from sale after the [[wt:en/news/7674-shop-may-sale-en|2022 May sale]], and was reintroduced as a Golden Eagle {{ge}} premium in [[Update \"Danger Zone\"]].\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->\nThe OF-40 (MTCA) has very little in the way of armour - effectively identical to both OF-40 models in the tech tree - with just enough to protect its crew from most frontal attacks from light autocannons - however even then the turret ring and some other small weak spots are reasonably vulnerable. Despite this, the OF-40's steep constructional angles may on occasion bounce even APFSDS rounds, while the (minimalist) spaced armour in the turret may absorb some less-powerful chemical rounds. Regardless, the safest approach is to avoid enemy fire whenever possible.\n\nThe OF-40's survivability is comparable to the [[Leopard A1A1 (L/44)]], as most of the vehicle's ammunition is stored in the hull adjacent to the driver, with a small portion of the ammunition being placed in primary stowage below the loader. The unfortunate result is that almost any hull penetration in the front half of the vehicle is liable to destroy ammunition with a high chance of detonation. Additionally, the turret crew are very poorly spaced and a well-placed round can easily knock out the entire crew simultaneously.\n\nThe result of the lack of survivability and armour is that the OF-40 (MTCA) is not viable as a front-line MBT, but rather should be played in flanking or sniping roles.\n\n'''Armour type:'''\n\n* Rolled Homogeneous Armour - Hull and Turret\n* High Hardness Rolled Armour - Turret\n* Rubber-Fabric Screens - Sideskirts\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The OF-40 (MTCA) will get you to a better position than the rest of the tanks if not in an uptier situation.\n\nThe main weaponry on this tank is the same as the [[Leopard (Family)|Leopard family]]. DM23 APFSDS shells are recommended for engaging armoured targets while you should also carry several M456 HEATFS and M416 smoke shells for special purposes.\n\nThe armour is not upgraded from the rest of OF-40 family. Although the OF-40 family has spaced armour all around the turret, you will not want to use this feature. While it is significantly more effective than the Leopard 1's turret armour, all main battle tanks can still penetrate you from all angles with ease using kinetic energy shells. The hull is as fragile as other Leopards, which is another reason why you don't want to take a shot.\n\nAlthough the OF-40 (MTCA) has night vision devices, it lacks thermal sights for both the gunner and the commander. You might want to get in cover such as bushes and buildings first before opening fire. Avoid sitting in the opening at all time, always get in cover after shooting.\n\nIn summary, OF-40 MTCA is a mixture of the OF-40 Mk. 2 and the TAM: it is a great tank in mobility and fire power. However, lacking armour and thermal camera limits its usage on certain maps around open areas.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness.

Italy had begun to develop a new MBT for the first time since the Second World War, known as the OTO Melara 'Leone'. This tank was being jointly co-developed by Italy and Germany, based on the Leopard but with some notable differences, such as the turret and armament being made by OTO Melara. The design didn't generate enough interest and ultimately the project wouldn't go further than a single prototype. However, this would kickstart OTO Melara to begin developing tanks and other armoured fighting vehicles once again. One of their earliest being the OF-40, O standing for OTO, F standing for Fiat and 40 standing for the approximate weight of the tank in tons.\n\nUnlike what many people believe, this tank was not based on any sort of Leopard, although it's evident by some of the design features that it would incorporate, that it at least drew inspiration from the Leopard. OTO Melara dealt with the armament, turret and FCS, whilst Fiat dealt with the hull, engine and transmission. In regards to the armament, it used a OTO Melara 105 mm rifled gun which was able to shoot most NATO standard ammunition, which included various HEAT, APDS, and HE rounds. Other armament included machine guns installed on top of the turret, either 7.62 mm or 12.7 mm. In terms of armour, the vehicle would offer slightly better protection than the Leopard tanks of the era, but it wasn't anything special. It also had access to smoke dischargers in case there was a need to disengage from a firefight. The base variant of the vehicle would use an MTU MB 838 KA 50 diesel engine, which allowed the vehicle to reach speeds of up to 60 km/h.\n\nAfter a few prototypes were completed, it was time to market the vehicle. Initially they attempted to sell it to the Italian army, however it didn't go well due to them already having access to many Leopard MBTs in service. So they instead began to market the vehicle to various Middle Eastern nations, one being the UAE. The UAE at the time didn't really have any decent main battle tank force, and although the OF-40 might not have been the best during the era, they still ended up buying the vehicle and putting it in service. The tank would finally go ahead for full-scale production. According to some sources, the UAE ended up getting up to 100 units in total, alongside a new variant of the vehicle in the ARV variant.\n\nOver time, the OF-40 Mk.1 began to show its age, thus a new variant was created which would be known as the OF-40 Mk.2. This vehicle would have a set of upgrades from the base variant, including the addition of a stabilizer, an LLTV and also new sensors and updates to the FCS (updated to use the Gallileo OG14L2A), such as the addition of a ballistic computer. The commander sight however was kept from the previous variant, being the French-made SFIM VS 580-B. The OF-40 Mk.2 would also serve in the UAE, where all previous Mk.1 variants would be retrofitted to the more modern variant.\n\nA very rare and obscure variant would be the OF-40 MTCA. The OF-40 (Mk.2) MTCA would be modified to allow for the installation of the Fiat MTCA V-12 1,000 hp engine, which increased the tank's speed by quite a lot. Only one OF-40 would receive such a package, it is unknown what happened after the tests. \n\nOther variants include the Palmaria and OTOMATIC, both based on a modified OF-40 hull. There was also the OF-40 Thetis, an OF-40 Mk.2 fitted with thermal imaging devices and extra armour, and lastly there was also the OF-40 Mk.3, an OF-40 which used the Palmaria hull with the Ariete preserie turret. Currently, all OF-40s in service with the UAE have been put into storage. One was converted to an HIFV by a company known as Sabiex. The UAE said that they wanted to donate these tanks to Kosovo but nothing materialized. Other OF-40 tanks and their variants currently reside in the 'Museo Della Melara' in La Speiza, Italy.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=it_of_40_mtca Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n;Other vehicles of similar configuration and role\n\n* [[Leopard 1 (Family)]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wt:en/news/6201-shop-of-40-mk-2-mtca-pre-order-en|[Shop] OF-40 Mk.2 MTCA pre-order]]\n* https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/391690-oto-melara-of-40-variants-and-derivatives/\n* https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/474469-of-40-thetis-mirabilandia-of-40/\n* https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/277682-of-40-or-leopard-a5-for-new-top-tier-position/\n\n{{TankManufacturer OTO Melara}}\n{{Italy medium tanks}}\n{{Italy premium ground vehicles}}"}}
