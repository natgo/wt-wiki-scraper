It was introduced in [[Update 1.85 \"Supersonic\"]].\n\nThe OTOMATIC is a radar-equipped SPAAG that is capable of shooting proximity fused frag rounds and can destroy planes even in a single, well-aimed shot. Shooting down aircraft should be the primary use of this vehicle at least until APFSDS rounds are unlocked, so staying in a cap zone is recommended, as the unit doesn't carry a lot of ammo (90 shells for a cannon with a 0.5s reload). When APFSDS are available, the OTOMATIC may defend capture points against enemy tanks as well, while still dealing with aircraft, or it can switch to a more mobile, MBT-like playstyle, mostly thanks to the excellent penetration of the sabot rounds and the two-axis stabiliser.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection.

This specific configuration is the Compact version, meaning the carousel is smaller for size reduction but with an increase in rate of fire. This particular gun, if already used in vessels, has one of the best trade-off in accuracy, stopping power and range. Different from other cannons, the 76 mm is the biggest anti-air calibre yet the smallest calibre for modern vehicles. The version mounted on the OTOMATIC is set to super-rapid fire, speeding the rate of fire from 60 RPM to 120 RPM. This has its own pros and cons. From one side you have a tremendous stopping power which can deal with all threats in seconds, including ground. However, on the other side, you devour ammunition when doing continuous fire, getting from 90 shells to 60 in a matter of seconds.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"100%\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" | [[OTO Breda Cannone da 76/62 (76 mm)|76 mm OTO Breda Cannone da 76/62]] || colspan=\"5\" | Turret rotation speed (°/s) || colspan=\"4\" | Reloading rate (seconds)\n|-\n!

It has a nice trade-off between anti-air and anti-tank capabilities due to the explosive mass and armour penetration. However, the SAPOM is not really suggested for anything rather than anti-tank roles as the HE-VT* is more than capable of dealing with enemy threats. It should be noted most of the targets faced can be killed from the sides if shot between the road wheels in the lower half of the chassis (in case for NATO tanks), engine deck (will only cause fire and damage to transmission), Gunner's Primary Sight (in case of M1 Abrams and XM-1s). When it comes to dealing with Russian targets (the most generally armoured MBTs in the game), SAPOM should be fire almost at the ground hitting the lowest part of the chassis. It is recommended to destroy their tracks and barrels in order to let friendly units take them out for this reason. SAPOM is capable of destroying all lightly-armoured targets seen at the battle-rating (IFVs, SPAAs, etc).\n\n'''APFSDS''' - The dart ammunition has a full anti-tank role though it can be used for anti-air roles, however it is not recommended. It has decent penetration and stopping power as a dart and is more than capable with dealing enemy tanks. It is able to destroy enemy targets in one hit if it's a well placed shot. Ammunition should be targeted with the APFSDS as the low amount of ammunition carrying can make it run out of APFSDS before destroying the enemy. Trapshots are suggested (driver's port, cupola, mantlets, etc).\n\n'''HE-MOM''' - The High Explosive Variable Time fuse proximity shell has a full anti-air role with zero anti-tank role. Thanks to the high calibre, the HE is able to carry a proximity fuse with a lethal explosive mass, making it capable of destroying all aerial threats with one or two hits. Trigger discipline is recommended as, due to the fast fire rate, the OTOMATIC can spend the whole ammunition reserve really fast. Thanks to being a big shell, most enemy helicopters and aircraft will not redirect course when being fired at until it's too late compared to the continuous fire smaller calibre SPAA have (25, 30, 35, 40 mm, etc). They do not trigger Missile Alert Warning systems, making them the ultimate helicopter killer.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"100%\"\n! colspan=\"8\" | Penetration statistics\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" data-sort-type=\"text\" | Ammunition\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Type of<br>warhead\n! colspan=\"6\" | Penetration @ 0° Angle of Attack (mm)\n|-\n! 10 m !! 100 m !! 500 m !! 1,000 m !! 1,500 m !! 2,000 m\n|-\n| 76/62 SAPOM || SAPHEI || 60 || 59 || 54 || 48 || 43 || 39\n|-\n| 76/62 APFSDS || APFSDS || 311 || 308 || 301 || 291 || 281 || 271\n|-\n| 76/62 HE-MOM || HE-VT* || 15 || 15 || 15 || 15 || 15 || 15\n|-\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"100%\"\n! colspan=\"10\" | Shell details\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" data-sort-type=\"text\" | Ammunition\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Type of<br>warhead\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Velocity<br>(m/s)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Projectile<br>Mass (kg)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Fuse delay<br>(m)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Fuse sensitivity<br>(mm)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Explosive Mass<br>(TNT equivalent) (g)\n! colspan=\"3\" | Ricochet\n|-\n! 0% !! 50% !! 100%\n|-\n| 76/62 SAPOM || SAPHEI || 910 || 6.35 || 1.2 || 14 || 662.4 || 79° || 80° || 81°\n|-\n| 76/62 APFSDS || APFSDS || 1,580 || 2.18 || N/A || N/A || N/A || 78° || 80° || 81°\n|-\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"100%\"\n! colspan=\"12\" | Shell details\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" data-sort-type=\"text\" | Ammunition\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Type of<br>warhead\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Velocity<br>(m/s)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Projectile<br>Mass (kg)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Fuse delay<br>(m)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Fuse sensitivity<br>(mm)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Explosive Mass<br>(TNT equivalent) (g)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Arming distance<br>(m)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Trigger radius<br>(m)\n! colspan=\"3\" | Ricochet\n|-\n! 0% !! 50% !! 100%\n|-\n| 76/62 HE-MOM || HE-VT* || 910 || 6.3 || 0 || 0.1 || 1,070 || 500 || 8 || 79° || 80° || 81°\n|-\n|}\n\n==== [[Ammo racks]] ====\n[[File:Ammoracks_{{PAGENAME}}.png|right|thumb|[[Ammo racks]] of the {{PAGENAME}}]]\n<!-- '''Last updated:''' 2.3.0.95-->\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\nThe OTOMATIC is one of the more role-diverse SPAA in the game, akin to that of the ADATS with its anti-air/anti-tank missiles. However, the OTOMATIC can practice these diverse roles without needing to notify the enemy of what role it is prior to an engagement. The {{PAGENAME}} has the mobility, speed, armour and electronics to make it one of the best SPAA or anti-tank vehicle, depending on what the commander or battlefield situation dictate.\n\nThe OTOMATIC has a big ammo rack with three types of ammunition for all types of players, for those who want to be deadly to only aircraft and control the skies as quickly as possible, and for those who want to carry out as much destruction as possible regardless if they want to go anti-air or anti-tank. The only drawback is that the OTOMATIC can only carry 12 APFSDS rounds. The recommended round load is 50 HE-VT*, 20 SAPOM, and 12 APFSDS for both anti-air and anti-tank capabilities. Each of these rounds are well-suited for the targets they are specialized to fight against.\n\n=== HE-VT* ===\nThis round makes nailing aircraft such an easy task, though it has its pros and cons compared to missiles that other high-ranking SPAA are using. As a con, a HE-VT* shell carries less explosive power, cannot be guided, and has a slower muzzle velocity compared to missiles. However, the HE-VT* as a shell will not trigger the aircraft's Missile Approach Warning system (MAW) and so the enemy may be caught unaware of an incoming 76 mm HE-VT* shell if they do not see it coming. The only visual cue they would have is the flying tracer round, compared to a missile smoke streak that may be traced to the firing SPAA vehicle. The larger number of HE-VT* shells carried also means the {{PAGENAME}} can quickly follow-up a shot if the first shot missed, without too much worry on ammunition waste.\n\nThis round helps make the {{PAGENAME}} one of the more reliable SPAA at the top-rank battlefield. A missile would cause hovering aircraft like helicopters to simply find cover as soon as the MAW is activated. Top-rank SPAA that uses missile also have a reliance to their radar lock, as it must maintain that lock for the missile to track and hit the target. The {{PAGENAME}} also has access to thermal sights and a laser rangefinder to help locate aircraft in the air and find their range without use of the radar. With this, the {{PAGENAME}} can track a helicopter and find their distance without the enemy helicopter being aware that they are within the {{PAGENAME}}'s sights and firing range.\n\n=== SAPOM ===\nThis round provides some flexibility in the usage of the {{PAGENAME}}. It is a Semi Armour-Piercing High-Explosive Incendiary (SAPHEI) round that does not have the penetration values of a likewise APCBC round, while also not having as much high-explosives as a dedicated HE shell. However, this round in the 76 mm calibre does still present some general-purpose uses. While there is enough high-explosives in the shell to use against an aircraft, the presence of the HE-VT* shell makes this role redundant by a more capable shell. The shell can fight enemy armoured fighting vehicles, but a maximum penetration of 60 mm at point-blank range means this round will struggle against any main battle tanks fought at the {{PAGENAME}}'s battle-rating. Nevertheless, as the only armour-piercing round available to the {{PAGENAME}} before it unlocks the APFSDS, it must be used with caution, patience, and practice for maximum efficiency.\n\nArguably one of the best use of the SAPOM round is as a reserve so that the valuable 12 APFSDS that can be carried in the {{PAGENAME}} is not wasted; or in the worst case all HE-VT* is spent. As such, its use should be reserved to fighting lightly-armoured vehicles, when out of APFSDS against ground units, or out of HE-VT* against air targets.\n\n====Fighting Specific Tanks with SAPOM====\n'''NATO allegiance MBTs (Leopard, Abrams, Leclerc, etc.)''':\n\n*When facing from the front:\n**Aim at the main gun to disable the tank's firepower. After that is disabled, aim for the tracks to immobilize the vehicle. Then allow a more capable ally destroy the enemy tank.\n\n*When facing from the side/rear:\n**Aim at medium lower section of a tank's hull sides, in between the road wheels where the armour is generally weaker.\n**If the {{PAGENAME}} is positioned to be somewhere towards the vehicle's rear, aim instead at the turret bustle ammunition rack. No tank has enough armour to withstand multiple hits to the ammo rack. Aiming at engine deck is worthless if gun is not disabled.\n\n'''CSTO allegiance MBTs (T-80, T-90, ZTZ-99, etc.)'''\n\n*When facing from the front:\n**Aim at the main gun to disable the tank's firepower. After that is disabled, aim for the tracks to immobilize the vehicle. Then allow a more capable ally destroy the enemy tank.\n\n*When facing from the side/rear:\n** Unfortunately, CSTO MBTs are often more well-armoured at the sides than NATO tanks, enough so to resist SAPOM rounds more easily with slight angling. As such, an attack with SAPOM rounds should not be attempted even from the sides.\n** If able to hit the vehicle's rear, the only place of worth the {{PAGENAME}} may penetrate is the engine deck. Shoot there to disable the enemy's mobility, but make sure to disable the enemy's gun as it reacts otherwise it may destroy the {{PAGENAME}}.\n\n'''Generally speaking, try and avoid combat with CSTO MBTs if the {{PAGENAME}} only has SAPOM rounds available, unless it is mission-critical that the enemy tank must be immobilized or disabled.'''\n\n=== APFSDS ===\nThis is probably the most used round by the OTOMATIC when it is being used for anti-tank purposes. This is the same round the Rooikat uses, meaning it is a reliable round with good capabilities, but does require trigger discipline, situational awareness and knowledge of the enemy tank's \"anatomy\" to make every single round count as there are only 12 round carried. While the APFSDS round has nowhere enough penetration power to deal with enemy MBT, it does have enough to penetrate weakpoints and from favourable angles of attack.\n\n'''NATO allegiance MBTs (Leopard, Abrams, Leclerc, etc.)''':\n\n*When facing from the front:\n**As explained above, utilize the terrain to the {{PAGENAME}}'s advantage against the enemy. However, a frontal encounter is highly discouraged\n\n*When facing from the side/rear:\n**Aim at the hull ammo racks\n***Leopard/Leclerc/Type 90: Next to driver\n***Abrams: Almost at engine deck, a small wall ammo rack\n**If able to hit the enemy from an angle closer to their rear, aim exclusively at turret bustle ammo rack. APFSDS will over-penetrate and make the blast shields useless.\n\n'''CSTO allegiance MBTs (T-80, T-90, ZTZ-99, etc.)'''\n\n*When facing from the front:\n**As explained above, utilize the terrain to the {{PAGENAME}}'s advantage against the enemy. However, a frontal encounter is highly discouraged\n\n*When facing from the side/rear:\n**Aim at the hull ammo racks\n***T-64s/T-80s: any hit to the side. Ammo rack is in an \"L\" shape, making ammo rack hits easy\n***T-72s/T-90: aim in a manner like if the target was a T-80, but closer to the ground due to ammo rack closer to the ground as it is in a \"=\" shape\n**If able to hit the enemy from an angle closer to their rear, aim exclusively at anywhere is possible to hit. Preferably the turret rear to disable critical modules or even hit an ammunition rack if there is any.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness.

The basic concept behind the OTOMATIC was to take the successful 76 mm Super Rapido utility cannon used on naval vessels and fit it to a suitable mobile platform in order to create a long-range SPAA vehicle that would outmatch similar designs such as the German Gepard or British Marksman system. Although a challenging feat, Italian engineers eventually succeeded in this endeavour, creating a vehicle that wasn't only up to the latest technological standards but also perfectly suited, and even exceeded, various NATO requirements of the time. The first prototype of the OTOMATIC was ready for testing in the late 1980s. Intended to be compatible with a large number of NATO vehicles of the time, the OTOMATIC, similarly to the British Marksman system, was tested on several hulls and it was planned to be capable of fitting any NATO tank, including the Leopard 2 and M1 Abrams. However, as the Cold War ended and general interest for SPAAG vehicles began declining in favour of more modern missile systems, the OTOMATIC project never received any interest from potential users. For the Italian army, the project was initially accepted, but later abandoned due to budget cuts.\n\n''- From [[wt:en/news/5943-development-otomatic-spaag-belated-perfection-en|Devblog]]''\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=it_otomatic Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n'''Images'''\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"150\">\nFile:OTOMATIC WTWallpaper 01.jpg|\nFile:OTOMATIC WTWallpaper 02.jpg|\nFile:OTOMATIC WTWallpaper 03.jpg|\nFile:OTOMATIC WTWallpaper 04.jpg|\nFile:OTOMATIC WTWallpaper 05.jpg|\nFile:OTOMATIC WTWallpaper 06.jpg|\n</gallery>\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|zn2-YsUBRBw|'''Should You Grind The OTOMATIC?''' - ''Sako Sniper''|J9nUjFDdk-E|'''The Shooting Range #131''' - ''Metal Beasts'' section at 00:32 discusses the OTOMATIC.|IntAZ778ewQ|'''OTOMATIC - Top Tier Balance - The Gaijin Way''' - ''Napalmratte''}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n;Vehicles equipped with the same chassis\n* [[OF-40 (Family)]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wt:en/news/5943-development-otomatic-spaag-belated-perfection-en|[Devblog] OTOMATIC SPAAG: Belated Perfection]]\n* [[wikipedia:Otomatic|[Wikipedia] Otomatic]]\n* [https://tanks-encyclopedia.com/otomatic/ <nowiki>[Tanks Encyclopedia]</nowiki> OTOMATIC]\n* [https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/435771-otomatic-spaag-belated-perfection/ [Forum<nowiki>]</nowiki> Official Forum Thread for the {{PAGENAME}}.]\n\n{{TankManufacturer OTO Melara}}\n{{Italy anti-aircraft vehicles}}"}}
