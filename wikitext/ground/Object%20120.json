The first is an APFSDS round that is capable of going through almost all the armour of most vehicles it can face. It also has an extremely low shell drop, giving almost flat ballistics, which makes it one of the best kinetic rounds at its battle rating. The second round is a HEATFS shell, which has a high penetration and holds a huge amount of explosive. It is slower and has a more standard shell drop. The HEATFS is a high-penetrating chemical round against thick conventional armour. The third is an HE shell with a huge amount of explosive. It is effective to destroy lightly armoured vehicles with overpressure.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"100%\"\n! colspan=\"8\" | Penetration statistics\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" data-sort-type=\"text\" | Ammunition\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Type of<br>warhead\n! colspan=\"6\" | Penetration @ 0° Angle of Attack (mm)\n|-\n! 10 m !! 100 m !! 500 m !! 1,000 m !! 1,500 m !! 2,000 m\n|-\n| 152 mm HEAT-FS || HEATFS || 480 || 480 || 480 || 480 || 480 || 480\n|-\n| 152 mm HE || HE || 49 || 49 || 49 || 49 || 49 || 49\n|-\n| 152 mm APDS-FS || APFSDS || 405 || 400 || 385 || 370 || 355 || 340\n|-\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"100%\"\n! colspan=\"10\" | Shell details\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" data-sort-type=\"text\" | Ammunition\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Type of<br>warhead\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Velocity<br>(m/s)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Projectile<br>Mass (kg)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Fuse delay<br>(m)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Fuse sensitivity<br>(mm)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Explosive Mass<br>(TNT equivalent) (g)\n! colspan=\"3\" | Ricochet\n|-\n! 0% !! 50% !! 100%\n|-\n| 152 mm HEAT-FS || HEATFS || 1,000 || 35 || 0.05 || 0.1 || 5,850 || 65° || 72° || 77°\n|-\n| 152 mm HE || HE || 960 || 43.5 || 0 || 0.1 || 5,900 || 79° || 80° || 81°\n|-\n| 152 mm APDS-FS || APFSDS || 1,710 || 8 || N/A || N/A || N/A || 76° || 77° || 80°\n|-\n|}\n\n==== [[Ammo racks]] ====\n[[File:Ammoracks_{{PAGENAME}}.png|right|thumb|x250px|[[Ammo racks]] of the {{PAGENAME}}]]\n<!-- '''Last updated: 2.7.0.122''' -->\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!

Refrain from creating a \"guide\" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\n\nThe Object 120 performs best in all game modes as a sniper/support. This means finding a good spot overlooking the battle with some cover, and taking out enemies from long range. The Object 120's long 152 mm gun and its powerful shells are well suited for this purpose.\n\nThe Object 120 can be used at a close-range battle, but it will not be able to perform as effectively due to its relatively long 10-second reload time and a lack of gun stabilizer. These two lacking features mean that the Object 120 cannot react to new threats quickly, especially when it tries to take the battle offensively. It is thus better to fight at range, where the Object's advantages can be used to the fullest.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as \"bad\", \"good\" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as \"inadequate\" and \"effective\".'' -->\n\n'''Pros:'''\n\n* Very high velocity APFSDS round means \"point and shoot\" at typical War Thunder combat ranges, no need to account for projectile drop at range\n* Outstanding armour penetration by HEAT-FS and APFSDS rounds\n* Very good spalling effect from the kinetic energy spread and explosive mass from HEAT-FS round\n* Good mobility for the size of gun\n* Has neutral steering\n\n'''Cons:'''\n\n* Weak armour: vulnerable to anything bigger than a heavy machine gun, and even those from some angles at short range\n* Poor depression for main armament\n* Low ammunition load\n* Poor optics for a tank destroyer with only 5x zoom\n* All projectiles carried in rear of turret behind thin armour makes ammunition explosions very likely from turret hits\n\n== History ==\n<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block \"/History\" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->\nThe Object 120 \"Taran\" was a tank destroyer developed after the USSR's conclusion that AP rounds from the T-10 and T-55 could not pierce the newest American tank the M60. The Object 120 (also noted as being the SU-152 \"Taran\") surpassed foreign tank destroyers with firepower and mobility at the time. The name Taran comes from its cannon which became the reason it wasn't adopted. The 125 smoothbore and anti tank missiles are the reason why the Object 120 was not put into production.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=ussr_object_120 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Images\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"150\">\nFile:Object 120 WTWallpaper 01.jpg|\nFile:Object 120 WTWallpaper 02.jpg|\nFile:Object 120 WTWallpaper 03.jpg|\nFile:Object 120 WTWallpaper 04.jpg|\nFile:Object 120 WTWallpaper 05.jpg|\nFile:Object 120 WTWallpaper 06.jpg|\nFile:Object 120 WTWallpaper 07.jpg|\n</gallery>\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|_xCgMBOiA8U|'''High-explosive power''' discusses the {{PAGENAME}} at 3:30 - ''War Thunder Official Channel''|xU4pGejnNyo|'''Object 120 \"Taran\" - What if everything sacrificed for ONE thing?
