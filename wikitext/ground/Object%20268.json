{"title":"Object 268","pageid":950,"wikitext":{"*":"{{Specs-Card\n|code=ussr_object_268\n|images={{Specs-Card-Image|GarageImage_{{PAGENAME}}.jpg}}\n}}\n\n== Description ==\n<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Soviet tank destroyer {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.69 \"Regia Aeronautica\"]]. The Object 268 is a self-propelled gun based on the T-10M heavy tank featuring a 152 mm M-64 cannon.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->\n\nOverall, the armour protection of the {{PAGENAME}} can be called reasonable, but not amazing. The hull, as it is a T-10 hull, has very good protection for most kinetic rounds it will face at the battle-rating, at least as long as most of them are being APDS and APCBC.\n\nThe tank destroyer  should not be angled because angle is already built-in into tank via hull pike and turret \"cheeks\". Angling from even 10 degrees negates the sloped armour. When not angled, the pike is able to deflect and stop APDS and full calibre kinetic rounds and cheeks often block direct shots at the ammo racks, as at various angles hull protection reaches up to 200 mm effective thickness. However, chemical rounds such as HEAT and ATGM will have no issues penetrating the entire construction and any chemical hit to the top will be able to reach ammo racks in the back. \n\nMoving to the turret, the area around the gun is poorly armoured even against APDS. It may visually resemble the [[Tiger II (H)]]'s turret, but it is not likely to stop APCBC shells directly fired at it, and should not be relied on to stop APDS, HEAT shells and ATGMs at all.\n\nOverall, this makes the {{PAGENAME}} very inconvenient to fight head-on with kinetic shells, particularly during a surprise attack, as it will win snapshot contests against many tanks despite not having a stabiliser. However, it will absolutely lose against vehicles equipped with HEAT shells and is very likely to lose to experienced tankers, as the way to disable and destroy the {{PAGENAME}} are basically one and the same: fire at the gun, worst case its gun will break, best case its ammo rack will explode. \n\nIt also has the same smoke screen barrels as the [[ASU-85]] and the [[SU-122-54]], which can be used to hide from aircraft or to break aim assist for the enemy in AB.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->\n\nMobility-wise, as it is a T-10 with a heavier gun and turret, it lacks speed as well as agility. However, the horsepower generated by the engine makes this a beast when moving obstacles and even dead tanks. \n\nThe mass can be seen as a pro and a con. Due to heavy mass, it has more traction and will not be flipped by explosions or rammed so easily by other tanks. However, the mass drastically reduces the top speed as well as the acceleration. Overall, it is a heavier, slower and less agile T-10.\n\nIn arcade mode, it might reach 54 km/h offroad when spaded, but overall it is slower than medium tanks.\n\nDepending on current upgrades, to freely turn around it needs to reach forward gear 5, 4, or 3. The higher the gear, the faster it can turn around, so keep this in mind when flanked. The reverse gear is not good enough to turn around when flanked.\n\n{{tankMobility|abMinHp=1,065|rbMinHp=663}}\n\n=== Modifications and economy ===\n{{Specs-Economy}}\n\n== Armaments ==\n{{Specs-Tank-Armaments}}\n=== Main armament ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Weapon|1}}\n<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun.

Add a link to the main article on the gun: <code><nowiki>{{main|Name of the weapon}}</nowiki></code>. Describe in general terms the ammunition available for the main gun. Give advice on how to use them and how to fill the ammunition storage.'' -->\n{{main|M-64 (152 mm)}}\n\nThe Object 268 is fitted with the 152 mm M-64 cannon, a very fearsome weapon at this BR with three potent rounds that are capable of destroying virtually any vehicle in the game, as long as the operator is skilled in its use. The ammunition loadout consists of HE, APHEBC and HEAT, all three of which are excellent solutions to various situations in a battle.\n\nThis 152 mm cannon has an usually long reload time for such a cannon. It is still faster to reload than the IS-3, which means it can fire more often.\n\nThe BR-540B APHEBC shell is arguably the best shell due to having higher angled penetration than the ones on the [[SU-122-54]], allowing it to annihilate tanks with a similar armour level to a [[T-54 (1951)]] at close range. When at long range, HEAT or HE shells should be used instead.\n\nThe OF-540 HE shell is decent enough at this tank's BR, as most enemy tanks once again have weak roof armour and can be destroyed by hitting their top machine gun, so the {{PAGENAME}} can countersnipe with it. Unfortunately, it is very difficult to hit such a small target without a rangefinder, and even with it, the shot can be quite impossible in RB.\n\nThe BP-540 HEAT projectile can be used just like APHEBC, but it will not knock out tanks in a single shot, despite having stats very similar to ATGMs. The HEAT shell on this tank is only marginally better in penetration statistics than the APHEBC and deals far less post-penetration damage. Overall it deals more damage than HEATFS round on the [[SU-122-54]], but has poor penetration and should be carried around only for long range engagements.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"100%\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" | [[M-64 (152 mm)|152 mm M-64]] || colspan=\"5\" | Turret rotation speed (°/s) || colspan=\"4\" | Reloading rate (seconds)\n|-\n!

Both have separate racks.\n* Projectiles and propellant bags are modeled individually and disappear after having been shot or loaded.\n* For the projectiles:\n** Rack 4 is a first stage ammo rack. It totals 17 projectiles and gets filled first when loading up the tank.\n** This rack is also emptied early: the rack depletion order at full capacity is: 4 - 1 - 2 - 3.\n* For the propellant bags:\n** Racks 5 and 6 are first stage ammo racks. They total 17 charges and get filled first when loading up the tank.\n** These racks are also emptied early: the rack depletion order at full capacity is: 6 - 5 - 1 - 2 - 3 - 4.\n* Simply not firing when the gun is loaded will move ammunition from other racks into ready racks. Firing will interrupt the restocking of the ready racks.\n\n=== Machine guns ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Weapon|2}}\n<!-- ''Offensive and anti-aircraft machine guns not only allow you to fight some aircraft but also are effective against lightly armoured vehicles. Evaluate machine guns and give recommendations on its use.'' -->\n{{main|KPVT (14.5 mm)}}\n\nThe Object 268 is armed with a single 14.5 mm KPVT heavy machine gun manned by the commander. It is effective in dispatching lightly armoured vehicles when used manually and is very useful when defending from air attacks. \n\nThis machine gun is loaded with 50-round belts, which only allows for a few short bursts punctuated with a lengthy reload. It also has no flash suppressor, so when you use it manually in sniper mode it will absolutely blind you, so aim first, fire after.\n\nIt technically can damage enemy gun barrels, but to fully deteriorate someone's gun, HMG will have to spend 2 belts worth of ammo, assuming they do not turn the gun away, so usually it is used to damage tracks of enemy heavy tanks so that they can't run away. However, since people often panic when they see their gun turning orange from being shot by MG and try to turn away, firing MG at the gun can be used with conjunction with smoke screen to prevent people from aiming for the tank's weak spots. \n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"50%\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" | [[KPVT (14.5 mm)|14.5 mm KPVT]]\n|-\n!

Refrain from creating a \"guide\" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\nThe Object 268 is far from being a frontline tank, especially when in uptier, meaning it has to stay away from the enemy's line of sight (LoS) due to the long reload time and relatively exposed weak spots. This does not mean it should be taken all the way through the outskirts of a map to get into position (can be done but not recommended on all maps). It should be used as a sniper in long range maps and a support vehicle in the rest. \n\nIt is able to defend itself pretty well if a good defensive position is found or set. Its armour makes it very inconvenient for most kinetic ammunition tanks to quickfire at it, so ambushes are a viable strategy. All close quarters combat (CQC) should be avoided, however, as the lack of turret and slow hull turn rate invites enemy tanks to flank you from all sides, and front is the only side you can defend yourself from them. \n\nThe only exception is if you can dictate the situation and your HMG is still functional, so that you can choose which way the enemy comes at you, and then detrack them so that they can't escape or rush you down. For example, some places in CQC environments (urban areas, city ravines, etc) can be used as choke point (holding a full street waiting for someone to push if that street is the only access point) due to its powerful gun and decent armour. This tank faces almost nothing that can be a too hard cookie to crack.\n\nIn AB, if you lay down an ambush, pay attention to ongoing air battles. If there is an incoming enemy plane (even a fighter) you should drop a smoke canister to avoid being marked on a map via \"radio communication\" skill. The fewer the people know where exactly you are and have direct aim assist support towards you, the better.\n\n'''List of opponents important notes when facing frontally:'''\n\n* [[Panzer V Panther (Family)|Panther]]/[[M48 Patton (Family)|M48]]/[[M26 (Family)|Pershing]]: all front can be penetrated by both rounds\n* [[M60 (Family)|M60]]: gun mantlet and upper front plate can be penetrated by BR540B.\n* [[Tiger II (Family)|Tiger II]]: gun mantlet can be penetrated by all rounds as well as hull (aim at right side of the turret if the tank is facing at you for a safe reload)\n* [[Centurion (Family)|Centurion]]: all front can be penetrated with all rounds\n* [[M103]]: hull has to be penetrated by BP540, center of mass shot has to be done frontally as the hull and turret are curvy, hull is impenetrable by all rounds\n* [[T32]]/[[T32E1]]: gun mantlet and hull have to be penetrated by BP540, aim at lower half of the frontal glacis to fire at ammunition rack\n* [[Maus]]/[[E-100]]: gun mantlet has to be penetrated by BP540 hull is impenetrable by all rounds.\n* [[Jagdtiger]]: gun mantlet has to be penetrated by BP540, hull can be penetrated by both rounds\n* [[Leopard 1 (Family)|Leopard 1]]/[[AMX-30 (Family)|AMX-30]]: all front can be penetrated with BR540B and higher penetration rounds\n* [[T95]]: gun mantlet and hull have to be penetrated by BP540\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness.

The concept began on 2 July 1952 at the Leningrad Kirov Plant on the order of the Council of Ministers USSR.<ref name=\"Kinnear1\" /> The Object 268 would follow in the same line of doctrine as had the earlier Soviet self-propelled guns of World War II, the ''SU-100'', ''-122'', and ''-152''. This contrasted with the Western concept of a self-propelled gun being used as an artillery piece rather than the Soviet usage as a tank destroyer.<ref name=\"Kinnear1\" /> There had been earlier attempts at converting a heavy tank to a self-propelled gun, using the chassis of the ''IS-4'' and ''IS-7'', but those had not been fully developed and were cancelled. The IS-4 production was running too slowly and the IS-7 had been too complex to manufacture in large numbers.<ref name=\"Kinnear2\" /> The Leningrad Kirov Plant worked to produce an SPG on the T-10 chassis by combining it with the 152 mm M-48 cannon, which had high velocity and was much more powerful than earlier 152 mm cannons. Drawing work led to the ''Object 730'' SPG which would be paired with the M-53 cannon, a parallel development to the M-48.<ref name=\"Kinnear3\" />\n\nThe Object 730 SPG had five different variants drawn up with each one being unique. Version No.1 was a front mounted casemate design which would be developed into the Object 268. Version No.2 had a rear casemate with the main armament using a drum magazine at the rear of the fighting compartment and the engine at the front of the vehicle.<ref name=\"Kinnear4\" /> Version No.3 abandoned the casemate design and used a conventional turret with all ammunition being stored in the rear of the turret.<ref name=\"Kinnear4\" /> Version No.4 was a slightly modified No.2 with a lengthened hull, addition of a second loader (bringing the crew to five) and a new cupola with a rangefinder and machine gun.<ref name=\"Kinnear5\" /> Version No.5, likewise, was a reworked No.3 to also bring the crew to five and the addition of a 14.5 mm KPV machine gun, along with it using the same engine as would be used in the T-10M.<ref name=\"Kinnear6\" /> Versions No.4 and 5 were rejected due to being too drastic of changes to the base design, and it was decided to go with a slightly modified Version No.1 with the same engine as the T-10M.<ref name=\"Kinnear7\" />\n\n=== Final Design and Prototype ===\nThe final design for the Object 268 was presented to the committee in June 1953 using technical drawings and a scale model, which was approved on 25 August by A.I. Radzievsky.<ref name=\"Kinnear7\" /> This would be armed with the 152 mm M-64 cannon along with a 14.5 mm KPVT machine gun on the roof of the casemate, along with a stereoscopic rangefinder. While the crew was kept at five (having two loaders), it was intended to have a crew of four as soon as an automated loading mechanism could be made for the M-64 cannon.<ref name=\"Kinnear7\" /> The main armament was being slowly developed due to being lower priority than 122 mm development, but the M-64 was created by taking the M-53 cannon and slightly shortening it while still maintaining a muzzle velocity of 750 m/s.<ref name=\"Kinnear8\" /> The final drawings for the Object 268 were finalized in June 1954, reviewed in August and construction on prototypes had begun in March 1955.\n\nWork continued on the M-64 cannon, with the prototype being completed in December 1955 and one being sent to Leningrad for installation into the Object 268 in February 1956. The prototype Object 268 was finally completed in March 1956 and was also still modified from the final drawings, as it was decided to use flat steel plates for the roof and rear of the casemate rather than the originally planned rounded plates as well modifications to allow the main armament to be installed and removed.<ref name=\"Kinnear9\" />\n\n=== Completed Vehicle and Cancellation ===\nThe completed Object 268 prototype was armed with the 152.4 mm M-64 cannon, built at the Leningrad plant, using the TSh-2A \"Sharik\" sight for direct fire and the ZiS-3 panoramic sight.<ref name=\"Kinnear10\" /> A TKD-09 stereoscopic rangefinder was mounted on the roof of the casemate along with a 14.5 mm KPVT heavy machine gun in a rotating ring above the gunner's hatch.<ref name=\"Kinnear10\" /> Full ammunition load was 35 rounds, with AP and HE-FRAG being available. The range at which a target could be engaged in direct fire was 900 m with a maximum indirect fire range of 13,000 m.<ref name=\"Kinnear10\" /> The hull of the Object 268 was 120 mm thick of RHA and the casemate was 187 mm. The engine used was the V-12-6 generating 750 HP, as well as using the same transmission as the T-10. Weight of the tank was 50 tonnes with a maximum speed of 48 km/h.\n\nThe Object 268 was ultimately cancelled, largely due to internal problems associated with the development of Soviet tanks. By the time the prototype was completed and trials had finished it was approaching the end of 1957 and even further development had been done. These designs had specifications and characteristics that were more advanced that the Object 268 and would have been so well protected that the M-64 cannon would have difficulty in taking them out.<ref name=\"Kinnear11\" /> It was expected that the Western tank development would also be able to defend against the Object 268, and the T-10 heavy tank had already begun production which could have caused issues if tank plants were made to manufacture a different version at the same time. In addition, a major shift in Soviet doctrine to incorporate more usage of anti-tank guided missiles, which had just been created in the Soviet Union in 1956.<ref name=\"Kinnear11\" /> The Object 268 was not accepted for mass production and further development of the Object 268 was halted, with only the single prototype having been made. It remains in the Kubinka tank polygon and museum.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=ussr_object_268 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|xF4-TcnyWw0|'''Best tank destroyers''' discusses the {{PAGENAME}} at 2:35 - ''War Thunder Official Channel''|zgrD_zQYWpc|'''{{PAGENAME}} Tank Review''' - ''NUSensei''|JXG_ov-Prr0|'''{{PAGENAME}}- Tank Review''' - ''Napalmratte''}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n* [[T-10M]] - Object 268 was developed on the hull of the T-10\n* [[ISU-152]] - Object 268 was intended as the successor to the ISU-152\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n=== References ===\n;Citations\n<references>\n<ref name=\"Kinnear1\">James Kinnear and Stephen L.
