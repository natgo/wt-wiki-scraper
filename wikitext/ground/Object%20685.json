Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Soviet light tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.91 \"Night Vision\"]].\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat?

Armour !! Front (Slope angle) !! Sides !! Rear !! Roof\n|-\n| Hull || 54 mm || 16 mm || 5 mm || 6 mm\n|-\n| Turret || 19 mm || 16 mm || 16 mm || 8 mm\n|}\n\n'''Notes:'''\n* Suspension wheels are 10 mm thick and tracks are 20 mm thick\n* The armour on the Object 685 is Alloy ABT-101. The armour values in the chart are displayed in rolled homogeneous armour equivalence.\n\nThe Object 685 is a very lightly armoured vehicle. The alloy may at first appear to be somewhat thick, but it is much less effective than rolled homogeneous armour at stopping rounds. The Object 685 can be killed by almost anything, with .50 calibre machine guns able to penetrate even parts of the front armour at close range. Additionally, the Object 685 is vulnerable to overpressure damage. The commander and gunner are somewhat far apart, but the Object has only 3 crew, so survivability is not particularly impressive. Generally, Object 685 drivers should not rely on their armour in any situation.\n\n=== Mobility ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}\n<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->\n\n{{tankMobility|abMinHp=620|rbMinHp=354}}\nMobility wise, the Object 685 can be considered as a \"heavier\" [[Object 906]]. It is not slow but is not the fastest light tank at the battle-rating. When downtiered, it is able to be faster than most tracked vehicles (most of them reach as most 65 kph while this can reach 75 kph) with exception of the [[Rooikat 105]], [[Rooikat Mk.1D]] and [[Radkampfwagen 90]]. It's suspension is a relatively soft suspension, meaning it will not damp as much in rough terrain but due to its thin tracks, the surface the tracks have on the floor make it be relatively slow on snow and sand (but faster than many tracked vehicles). It is fully amphibious which makes the Object 685 capable of crossing water bodies which can give an advantage (Eastern Europe river for example) but the speed while on water is lacklustre.\n\n=== Modifications and economy ===\n{{Specs-Economy}}\n\n== Armaments ==\n{{Specs-Tank-Armaments}}\n=== Main armament ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Weapon|1}}\n<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun. Assess its effectiveness in a battle based on the reloading speed, ballistics and the power of shells. Do not forget about the flexibility of the fire, that is how quickly the cannon can be aimed at the target, open fire on it and aim at another enemy. Add a link to the main article on the gun: <code><nowiki>{{main|Name of the weapon}}</nowiki></code>. Describe in general terms the ammunition available for the main gun. Give advice on how to use them and how to fill the ammunition storage.'' -->\n{{main|2A48 (100 mm)}}\n\nThe Object 685 has the same ballistics as the [[D-10T2S (100 mm)|D-10T2S]] 100 mm cannon even sharing the same ammunition. Thus, the use of the gun should be the same as the [[T-55A]]. The gun is capable of destroying all enemy vehicles it faces from the front (with exception of the [[Maus]] glacis) with its powerful APFSDS shell. Despite not having the most powerful dart at the battle rating, the 6 second reload of the autoloader makes the Object 685 a formidable quick firing tank, capable of destroying multiple enemies with relative speed.\n\n'''Important: ''in order to let the autoloader load, the gunner must be alive'''''\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"100%\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" | [[2A48 (100 mm)|100 mm 2A48]] || colspan=\"5\" | Turret rotation speed (°/s) || colspan=\"4\" | Reloading rate (seconds)\n|-\n!

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\n'''Gameplay Stock:'''\n\nThe Object 685 is much less powerful when stock. It is equipped with the 3BK17M HEAT-FS shell, which is generally inferior to the 3BM25 shell. Another issue while stock is the mobility, which is not as impressive when stock. Another issue is the lack of the Airstrike modification, which makes spawning in air vehicles easier in ground RB after scouting.\n\n'''Gameplay Spaded:'''\n\nThe Object 685 is a highly mobile Soviet light tank which has an excellent cannon. Its disadvantages are thin armour and a lack of thermal sights. Object 685 players should avoid areas with heavy foliage, as the lack of thermals will prove detrimental in these areas. The best strategy with the Object 685 is flanking the enemy team using the Object 685's mobility. The amphibious capability can help create new avenues of attack when flanking. The scouting ability also helps the team while on the flanks. One tactic to avoid in the Object 685 is using the ESS system, as enemy thermal sights can see through the smoke, while the Object 685 will effectively blind itself.\n\n'''Close Range Engagements:'''\n\nThe Object 685 can fare well at close range due to the excellent gun handling and reload rate. Additionally, the mobility of the vehicle allows it to easily outmanoeuvre enemies at close range.\n\n'''Long Range Engagements:'''\n\nThe Object 685 may have difficulty in prolonged long range engagements. The main armament is excellent, but the Object is held back by its lack of thermal sights and low survivability. The lack of thermals means that seeing your target may be difficult at long range. Additionally, the low survivability means that the Object 685 will not survive most hits, even at long range.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness.

The requirements were sent to three different design bureaus, with each bureau developing its own vehicle around the given specifications.\n\nOne of the proposed designs, the Object 788, was disqualified early from the competition due to being incomplete and missing several key features mandated by the requirements. The other two designs, the Object 685 and Object 934 were both deemed as sufficient, and work on them continued. By the mid 1970s, both vehicles were built and tested, but neither managed to garner enough interest to warrant a production order being issued. Despite not making it past the prototype stage, design solutions from both vehicles were later applied to other Soviet fighting vehicles.\n\n''- From [[wt:en/news/6332-development-object-685-return-of-the-river-mosquito-en|Devblog]]''\n\nIn the 1970s, the Russian Ministry of Defense opted to create a replacement for the PT-76, the main to contestants being the PT-85 (also known as Object 906) and the Object 685. It was tested but did not enter service or combat. It featured components that were later used for multiple vehicles, this being the Object 688 (which ended being the BMP-2), BMD-3 and 2S25 Sprut-SD (based on BMD-3). It was made for airborne units to maintain the armoured section of airborne units, at the time those being PT-76, BMD-1 and ASU-85. It featured a greater weight than the PT-76 due to the size and main gun but featured a more compact suspension due to being a telescopic hydraulic shock absorbers and suspension.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=ussr_object_685 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n== See also ==\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wt:en/news/6332-development-object-685-return-of-the-river-mosquito-en|[Development] Object 685: Return of the River Mosquito]]\n\n{{USSR light tanks}}"}}
