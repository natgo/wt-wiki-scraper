Refrain from creating a \"guide\" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\nAs with every other light tank, this vehicle should be handled with caution on the battlefield since any enemy the 906 encounters can penetrate it. Use its awesome mobility and good, stabilized gun to provide a nasty surprise to the enemy from unexpected spots. Whether by river, lake, ocean, the 906 can navigate through all bodies of water within the limit of the battlefield. This tank is best used as a flanker, shooting on the move, reloading in the dark, popping up behind another hill to take another moving shot, this is a ninja tank.\n\nFor your ammo loadout: Take 20 shells in total, this removes the ammo rack at the back of your turret. Take more if you want to boost yourself by firing your gun to the opposite side of where you are driving. Two-thirds APHE and one-third HEAT-FS is recommended. Warning: with its 4.3 seconds reload though, taking less ammo puts you at risk of running out.\n\n;Combat tactics\n\n'''Flanker'''\n\nNever fight an enemy head-on since the 906 will have to aim for the enemy's weak spots before firing while they don't have to worry about the same precision. Surprise is the 906's greatest advantage. Use the Object 906's great speed to take strange, curvy, distant paths to snipe the enemy from the rear/side early in the game. Do not forget to change cover often (every 2-3 shots) since those enemies can respawn and go straight towards the original firing position with its front armour towards it, resulting in much more difficult shots. In this case, use the 906's speed to fall back behind much more armoured allies and look at the map to see where allies may need help/where an enemy has been holding out for long.\n\nWhen flanking, unlike many other tanks: show the side armour. Since the armour cannot block any shot at this BR, speed is the Object 906's best option, just evade the shots and slow down solely to shoot at the enemy. In the occurrence, the tank gets hit, keep in mind that this lengthy vehicle makes APDS and HEAT rounds ineffective since they often pass straight through, such shot from the front could incapacitate all three crew members. Taking shots from the sides \"isolates\" each module for non-HE shells in such a way that they will only incapacitate one part of the tank at the time: the driver, the gunner or the engine. If the engine or driver gets shot, the inertia will often drag the 906 out of sights from the enemy. If the gunner gets shot, the 906 can still move behind cover to hide, the lack of gunner would then prevent the player from exposing the tank in an area the enemy knows is there. Just like a ninja, after taking a shot: hide, repair, reevaluate the situation, then move out to cause more havoc from unsuspecting locations.\n\nIf an aircraft is aware of your presence search cover or hide in a treeline, '''Do not''' give away your exact location to the aircraft by firing at it. Putting bushes on top of your tank is a good idea.\n\n'''Rush'''\n\nOne may be tempted to charge and capture the point for the team at the beginning of a game. In such a case, a cooperative team is necessary since the 906 cannot hold the point all by its lonesome. When capturing the point, turn the engine deck towards the enemy. This tactic can actually save the 906 from hasty shots to the hull without hindering the gun arc, though this will cause engine fires which can lead to a burning end if not handled quickly. In this case, take a shot at the now vulnerable foe and then use the FPE item to extinguish the fire. If the point gets swarmed by enemies, fall back and wait for allies to regroup for a counter-attack.\n\n'''Decoy'''\n\nAnother unusual tactic is to attract enemy players' focu to the 906's location. Use the amphibious capability and other great mobility features to put the 906 in a tricky position to reach for a non-floating/non-flying enemy (often down a cliff, beside/in the water) in such a way that some players will fall into the trap of trying to reach the 906 through methods that expose their sides to allies or falling into the water. This tactic is very situational and is not a method that should be prioritized over any other tactics. It may not win battles, but it could destroy a few enemies, reducing the number of enemies threatening the overall allied team.\n\n;Tank Assault\n\nThe Object 906 is a very capable tank in Tank Assault gamemode, largely due to its very fast reload rate, and extremely low cost (almost 4 times cheaper than MBTs / medium tanks). Since the AIs in Tank Assault don't try to angle their armour or present their front, their sides are very often exposed, which allows the Object 906 to quickly rack up kills. You should aim to take a position where you are covered from most sides except the direction where you are shooting, but you shouldn't worry about dying, at all.\n\nGenerally, your role should be taken as the set-up/clean-up tank. You will often track or set enemies on fire, which makes them easy to pick-off for your team, or your armour-piercing shell with high explosives will cleanly one-shot the tank. With that shell, you can also clear out any stationary AIs, even if they are at a slight angle. Remember that top-tier vehicle (Abrams, Challengers etc.) have almost no lower side armour, and you can often penetrate and kill those tanks from the side at angles up to (almost) 60°.\n\n;Notable enemies\n\nAny tank is a threat that should be avoided, flanked, and destroyed. However, some tanks are impervious to these tactics:\n\nThe [[Maus]] has thick flanks at nearly 200 mm that can absorb any shots if angled properly. Do not shoot at it since it will only bring this behemoth to turn itself against the 906 (in this case, just withdraw from its firing arc). Still, it can be defeated in a manner like mammoth hunting: wait until the target gets isolated and encircle it, then shoot it on the sides, in the rear of the hull and always try to be out of its line of sight.\n\n[[T95]] (otherwise known as \"Doom turtle\") should not be engaged. Its good all-around bouncy armour will defeat most shots even from the Object 906 will take on the move. To defeat it, take some height at its flank and aim carefully, otherwise, it will just drag its attention. This worthy opponent has a very fast hull turning rate, turning it into an impervious wall even towards any adversary, including the 906 if it notices it. Engage only if necessary.\n\nWith the [[Tortoise]], the same caution is advised but it is way easier to flank since its side armour is flat.\n\nBe cautious while aiming at [[IS-3]], [[IS-4M]] and [[T-10M]] since their sides can bounce the 85 mm shots.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as \"bad\", \"good\" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as \"inadequate\" and \"effective\".'' -->\n\n'''Pros:'''\n\n* Tank has the fastest gun reload in the rank, tied with [[JaPz.K_A2]]\n* Has an autoloader, meaning that\n** A high \"Weapon Reload\" skill on its crew isn't needed\n** The gun will be reloaded while extinguishing a fire\n** Injured crew won't slow its reload rate\n* Very hard-hitting 85 mm, even for Rank V matches\n** Comes with an APHE as a standard shot - easily capable of one-shotting tanks from the side\n** The unlockable HEATFS shell lets the 906 comfortably fight heavier tanks\n* Two-plane stabilized gun allows to fire on the move and while braking on almost any terrain\n* Amphibious capability lets you move around maps with bodies of water more easily - rivers can also be easily crossed\n* Very fast reverse speed, about -45 km/h, with fast acceleration towards -70 km/h \n* Has neutral steering\n\n'''Cons:'''\n\n* Virtually no armour\n* Only 3 crewmen limits the survivability\n* Turret bustle is protected by only 8 mm, heavy machine guns can easily penetrate and detonate the ammunition in the autoloader\n* Overall, turret front is vulnerable to HMG at short distances\n* Prone to destruction by overpressure\n* Stock experience is horrible\n** Mobility and accuracy are bad until relevant upgrades are researched and bought\n* Awful gun depression of -5°\n* Two-plane stabilizer becomes ineffective at speeds above 35-40 km/ph, especially on rough terrain\n* When firing from the water, can accidentally sink itself\n\n== History ==\n<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction.

The PT-76 chassis was taken up by the Stalingrad Tractor Factory in 1962 to be improved.<ref name=\"Russianprototype\">Preserved Tanks, ''Light Tank Development Prototype''</ref> The vehicle was given the project name '''Object 906'''. Two were produced and tested between 1962-1963, each armed with an 85 mm cannon and also implemented the newer technology such as gun stabilization, auto-loader, and a welded aluminium armour for weight-saving.<ref name=\"WT906\">War Thunder, ''Object 906: River Mosquito''</ref> The design proved reliable with a 300 hp engine and could reach a top speed of 75 km/h. Had it been adopted, the Object 906 would've been given the name PT-85, but the vehicle design never left the prototype stages and consequently never adopted. A single prototype still exists in Kubinka Tank Museum.\n\nThe Object 906 should not be confused by another project of the same name and purpose to upgrade the PT-76, though this one had a 90 mm D-62 gun and never left the drawing boards<ref name=\"Russianprototype\" />. There was also a separate PT-85 that also had a PT-76 chassis with an 85 mm gun, though this model had a cast turret.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=ussr_object_906 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|Fjh-tTr6TPs|'''Best Combo #2'''  discusses the {{PAGENAME}} at 4:27  - ''War Thunder Official Channel''|SJoW-2_6J6o|'''Amphibious tanks'''  discusses the {{PAGENAME}} at 4:38  - ''War Thunder Official Channel''|GoXrA91hUSk|'''{{PAGENAME}} Tank Review''' - ''NUSensei''|CNyryM-9g7g|'''{{PAGENAME}} - Tank Review - Frantic Biting''' - ''Napalmratte''|UDvzWT2BSg4|'''The Shooting Range #28''' - ''Metal Beasts'' section at 00:44 discusses the {{PAGENAME}}.}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n;Related development\n* [[PT-76 (Family)]]\n\n;Other vehicles of similar configuration and role\n* [[Object 685]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wt:en/news/4351-development-object-906-river-mosquito-en|[Devblog] Object 906: River Mosquito]]\n\n===References===\n<references />\n\n{{USSR light tanks}}"}}
