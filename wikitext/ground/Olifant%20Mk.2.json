Foreign designs such as the French Leclerc and British Challenger 2 were studied and it was planned that the new MBT was to have an entirely new hull from the Olifant Mk1B. But, due to a greater need of the budget for the navy and air force, a new tank was scratched from plans in 1988. Instead, an upgrade of the Olifant Mk1B would have to suffice.\n\nThe main areas that were upgraded on the Olifant Mk2 were the mobility, crew ergonomics, and fire control system (FCS).\n\n'''Design'''\n\n'''General'''\n\nThe Olifant Mk2 maintains the standard crew of four and the general layout from the preceding Olifant variants but with improvements to specific areas such as mobility and fire control system (FCS).\n\nFor increased ergonomics, two water tanks are fitted in the turret to store a total of 101 liters of water for the crew. The water tanks can be accessed from the loader and commander's stations.\n\n'''Mobility'''\n\nOne of the Olifant Mk2's two largest improvements over the Olifant Mk1B was its mobility. The engine was still the Continental 29 liter turbocharged air cooled engine, but it was modified to increase the horsepower output to 1,040 horsepower (an increase of 190 horsepower). The transmission of the Olifant Mk1B was retained, which had four forward and two reverse gears. The Olifant Mk2 could achieve a maximum speed of 58 km/h (the same speed as the Mk1B) but it accelerated 25% faster than the Mk1B. The improved torsion bar suspension of the Mk1B was also retained.\n\nThe fuel capacity of the Olifant Mk2 was reduced from 1,382 litres to 1,285 litres compared to the Mk1B. Despite the reduced fuel load, the maximum range remained at approximately 360 km - the same as on the Mk1B.\n\n'''Armament'''\n\nThe armament of the Olifant Mk2 was retained from the Olifant Mk1B.\n\nThe main armament of the Olifant Mk2 consisted of a 105 mm GT3B rifled gun, which was a variant of the Royal Ordnance L7 that was produced in South Africa by Lyttleton Engineering Works (LEW). The gun was fitted with a thermal sleeve as standard.\n\nFour types of ammunition were carried for the 105 mm gun: M9210 HE, M456 HEAT, M9718 APFSDS, and white phosphorus smoke shell. A total of 64 105 mm shells were carried in the tank.\n\nThe electrical turret and gun control system fitted to the Olifant Mk2 allowed for a full 360 degree rotation of the turret in 16 seconds. The extended turret bustle at the rear of the turret helped to increase space for storage and equipment, but more importantly it balanced out the heavy armour on the frontal side of the turret. This helped to reduce strain on the turret control system.\n\nA new fire control system (FCS) was used that included hunter-killer capability, in which the gunner and commander could each search for targets and control the turret systems. The gunner's sight was fitted with thermal imaging and the commander also received an independent thermal viewer (CITV). The gunner was provided with a targeting screen that displayed the sight image along with the data from the ballistic computer and integrated laser rangefinder, and the commander could also view the image from the gunner's sight. The FCS included an automatic tracking function in which the turret would automatically track a target selected by the gunner or commander even while on the move. The gun was fully stabilized, allowing for a good hit-on-the-move capability and the FCS allowed a high accuracy in general.\n\nSecondary armament was provided by a coaxial 7.62 mm machine gun with 6,600 rounds of ammunition carried.\n\n'''Armour'''\n\nThe armour of the Olifant Mk2 was identical to that of the Olifant Mk1B. The base armour was the same as on the Olifant Mk1A but a layer of passive composite armour was added (spaced from the base armour) on the turret and also on the upper glacis of the hull. The hull floor was changed to a double layered design in order to better protect against mines and explosives. The armoured sideskirts were also improved in regards to the Olifant Mk1A in order to increase protection against handheld anti-tank weapons such as the RPG-7.\n\nA fire suppression system was installed in both the crew and engine compartments for automatic extinguishing of fires. Two banks of four smoke grenades each are fitted on each side towards the rear of the turret. An engine exhaust smoke system is fitted to allow the generation of a smoke screen by injecting fuel into the engine exhaust.\n\n'''Production and Service'''\n\nA total of 26 Olifant Mk2 tanks were built starting in 2005, entering service with the South African National Defense Forces (SANDF; replaced the SADF in 1994). Four of the Olifant Mk2 tanks were used for training as of 2018 and the other 22 were in storage. They had not yet seen combat.<ref>https://tanks-encyclopedia.com/modern/south-africa/Olifant-mk2-main-battle-tank/</ref>\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=uk_olifant_mk_2 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|brTNf5hXVGM|'''The Shooting Range #242''' - ''Metal Beasts'' section at 00:28 discusses the {{PAGENAME}}.}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.''\n\n=== References ===\n<references />\n\n{{Britain medium tanks}}"}}
