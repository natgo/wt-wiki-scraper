In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} German self-propelled anti-aircraft gun {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.91 \"Night Vision\"]], replacing the [[Flakpanzer 341]] in the German tech tree.\n\nThe {{PAGENAME}} is an average SPAAG which definitely has nothing to look for on the front line, however, there is a great advantage with its double cannon which becomes extremely dangerous for enemy aircraft which fly within range.\n\nThe {{PAGENAME}} has sufficient penetrating power to destroy [[M18 GMC|M18]]s or other light armoured vehicles, however, one should rather concentrate on enemy aircraft. The reasoning behind this is because the turret is open from above and weakly armoured on the sides, so is vulnerable to enemy aircraft fire and vehicles that carry .50 calibre machine guns.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->\n[[File:Ostwind II armour.jpg|alt=Ostwind II armour|right|thumb|x200px]]\n\nThe frontal hull armour (80 mm) is quite well protected against small-calibre weapons and [[M2HB (12.7 mm)|.50 caliber BMG]]s, the sides (30 mm) and rear (20 mm) are not as well protected.\n\nThe turret is open at the top and has a rectangular recess in the right, frontal turret armour, because of the optics.\n\nIn addition, the steel of the turret (25 mm) is very weakly armoured, as well as the hull roof (10-12 mm).\n\nSince the vehicle has a crew of six, with the driver and the machine gunner/radio operator in the hull, it usually survives the first attack from enemy aircraft as well as a shot into the turret.\n\n=== Mobility ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}\n<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->\n\n{{tankMobility|abMinHp=426|rbMinHp=265}}\n\nThe {{PAGENAME}} does not have that great average speed, which means that the 39 km/h will be rare on the battlefield. Forget about trying to turn on the spot as this vehicle does not have neutral steering. Even worse is attempting to use the reverse gear (-7 km/h) which is extremely insufficient presenting an easy target if having to back out of a tight situation.\n\n=== Modifications and economy ===\n{{Specs-Economy}}\n\n== Armaments ==\n{{Specs-Tank-Armaments}}\n=== Main armament ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Weapon|1}}\n<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun. Assess its effectiveness in a battle based on the reloading speed, ballistics and the power of shells. Do not forget about the flexibility of the fire, that is how quickly the cannon can be aimed at the target, open fire on it and aim at another enemy. Add a link to the main article on the gun: <code><nowiki>{{main|Name of the weapon}}</nowiki></code>. Describe in general terms the ammunition available for the main gun. Give advice on how to use them and how to fill the ammunition storage.'' -->\n{{main|FlaK44 (37 mm)}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"100%\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"6\" | [[FlaK44 (37 mm)|37 mm FlaK44]] (x2) || colspan=\"5\" | Turret rotation speed (°/s) || colspan=\"4\" | Reloading rate (seconds)\n|-\n!

Refrain from creating a \"guide\" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\n\n;Realistic Battles\n\nThe {{PAGENAME}} should be held in reserve, for towards the end of the game when there tends to be a significant amount of enemy aircraft flying. It is best to avoid the front lines or beating feet toward the enemy tanks as the {{PAGENAME}} tends to be an easy target for a majority of the other tanks in the game.\n\nIf your own team is about to lose or it gets very exciting towards the end and there are not many enemies left alive, you can place your {{PAGENAME}} inside an allied capture-point to defend it from enemy light tanks. Due to the location, it is more central to the battlefield and presents a difficult challenge for enemy aircraft to attempt to fly over.\n\nIt should also be kept in mind that if impenetrable heavily armoured enemies are encountered and you are left with no other option but to engage them, firing in a sustained manner at their cannon barrel is a semi-viable idea. This is because it is entirely possible that it will result in a damaged cannon barrel for the enemy and a chance to escape for you. Furthermore, you can target the tank tracks as well to leave the enemy both harmless and immobile which may possibly get you a kill assist if a teammate with enough firepower is nearby. Any tank with top mounted machine guns will be sure to ruin the day, as most within the Ostwind's BR range will have plenty of penetrating power to hit anyone inside your turret. Avoidance of most American and Russian armor is highly recommended due to their exterior armaments.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness.

First conceived as early as October 1943, the Ostwind II saw the single 3.7 cm FlaK 43 replaced by a twinned 3.7 cm FlaK Zwilling 44 built by the ''Gustloff-Werke'' in Suhl. One single prototype was delivered to the ''Panzerflak-Ersatz und Ausbildungsabteilung Ohrsdurf/Thühringen'' in January of 1945 for evaluation purposes, but due to the rapid events of the war it was never taken into production.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=germ_flakpanzer_IV_Ostwind_2 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|naeDoEwZ5Pg|'''German SPAAs''' discusses the {{PAGENAME}} at 3:44 - ''War Thunder Official Channel''|Tvf5Z49Tjc4|'''{{PAGENAME}}: Same Old Wind But Stock''' - ''Napalmratte''|KHoF40aIeEU|'''The {{PAGENAME}} SPAA''' - ''Orangefan''}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n* [[Ostwind]] - Predecessor with a single 37 mm FlaK 43 autocannon.\n* [[Flakpanzer 341]] - Gift vehicle that the Ostwind II substituted in the main tech tree.\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wt:en/news/6317-development-changes-and-optimization-in-the-german-tech-tree-en|[Development] Changes and optimization in the German tech-tree]]\n\n{{Germany anti-aircraft vehicles}}"}}
