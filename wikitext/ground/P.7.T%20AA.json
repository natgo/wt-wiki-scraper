In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} French self-propelled anti-aircraft vehicle {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.75 \"La Résistance\"]]. With its four 13.2 mm Hotchkiss Mle 1930 machine guns, it poses a certain threat to enemy aircraft while featuring poor mobility (off-road) and armour.\n\nThe P.7.T AA is a very classic interwar anti-air defence system with its guns mounted on a mobile but vulnerable chassis.\n\nWith only 3 exposed crew members, anything can damage, disable or destroy this vehicle. Its armour does not provide enough cover to the crew from any angle. Even .30 cals guns can easily destroy this vehicle, so be sure to stay out of sight from enemies.\n\nThe half-track configuration usually provides increased off-road mobility to wheeled vehicles while enabling to carry more weight over the tracked section, a rule to which the P.7.T AA is no exception: It ''can'' reliably move itself across any rough terrain. The only downside to this vehicle is its low HP, which makes hill climbing quite slow. This little engine also struggles to bring this much weight to its max speed: One should go downhill ''and'' hit the gas in order to reach 40 km/h. Turning on the spot is also a no-go since the tracks do not provide enough traction to the ground: Hit the forward key and gain some speed ''before'' attempting any manoeuvre. Be patient and choose your path wisely and you should reach your destination soon enough.\n\nWith its four HMGs, this SPAA is quite reminiscent of the [[GAZ-AAA (4M)]] while having much more firepower. Since these weapons fire simultaneously, one hit usually means four holes in your opponent, a heavy toll to the early planes (and biplanes) you will be shooting at this BR.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->\n\n'''Armour type:'''\n\n* Structural steel (chassis, gun mount)\n* Wheel (front tires)\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Every crew member sits exposed to enemy fire, so even a light machine gun can knock out the entire crew in a matter of seconds. This means that the {{PAGENAME}} should never be exposed to any enemy fire, including artillery barrages, enemy ground fire and more difficultly strafing attacks from aircraft. The only parts of the vehicle that might stop a rifle-calibre round are the engine block and the gun mount.\n\n=== Mobility ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}\n<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->\n\n{{tankMobility|abMinHp=28|rbMinHp=18}}\n\nThe mobility is above average and smooth overall, while no terrain poses a challenge due to the half-track system. Due to the relatively high potential speed, the {{PAGENAME}} can quickly get into an advantageous position on the map to shoot down planes. Just be sure to keep an eye out for flanking light tanks or fast medium tanks such as the Panzer III and IV, as anything can annihilate you with mere MG fire.\n\n=== Modifications and economy ===\n{{Specs-Economy}}\n\n== Armaments ==\n{{Specs-Tank-Armaments}}\n=== Main armament ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Weapon|1}}\n<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun.

With their above-average fire rate, high damage, good accuracy and decent reload speed, they are an AA jockey's dream. It is worth noting that they have a limited magazine capacity, only 30 rounds per gun, but this is more-or-less remedied by the fact that there are 4 guns, allowing for 120 rounds total.\n\nHowever, due to the P.7's low BR, they can be decent at destroying reserve and 1.3 tanks from the sides and rear. It is not recommended to use it in this fashion, as you leave yourself as an easy target for anything with guns.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"100%\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"6\" | [[Hotchkiss Mle 1930 (13.2 mm)|13.2 mm Hotchkiss Mle 1930]] (x4) || colspan=\"5\" | Turret rotation speed (°/s) || colspan=\"4\" | Reloading rate (seconds)\n|-\n!

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\n\n'''Overview:'''\n\nThe P.7.T AA has a total lack of armour, so the best strategy is to stay away from enemy ground vehicles and focus on planes. However, the guns do have some penetration, so targeting enemy ground vehicles is a possibility. The limited mobility and lack of armour make fighting enemy ground vehicles very difficult for the P.7.T AA.\n\n'''Tips:'''\n\nPlaying the P.7.T by focusing on air targets is the most viable strategy. Do not spawn this vehicle early game since there will be few planes to shoot at. Do not engage aircraft too early, as you will only expose yourself. Begin firing at less than 1 km range for the best effect. Always watch out for multiple aircraft, as if they strafe you, you will almost certainly die. The guns are surprisingly potent, and will quickly dispatch most air targets after a few hits, although some heavy fighters and bombers may prove challenging to destroy. When engaging enemy tanks, you can reverse from behind a building to only expose the gunner to enemy fire.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as \"bad\", \"good\" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as \"inadequate\" and \"effective\".'' -->\n\n'''Pros:'''\n\n* Four 13.2 mm machine guns, able to destroy weakly armoured foes like the [[Ha-Go (Family)|Ha-Go]], [[AS 42]] or [[T-26]], and aircraft like the [[He 51 (Family)|He 51]]\n* AP-I/API-T belt as default means it has anti-tank potential even when stock\n* Excellent at actually being an SPAA. A high rate of fire and powerful rounds will shred planes at the rank\n* Good at suppressing enemy vehicles\n* Light: easy to tow from enemy fire when immobilised\n* Can damage some tanks from their weaker sides, like the [[LVT (Family)|LVT(A)]] series, [[Pz.IV C]] or [[Pz.II (Disambiguation)|Pz.II]]\n* Does not lose too much speed when turning due to the half-track configuration\n\n'''Cons:'''\n\n* Very low survivability - the crew is exposed, extremely vulnerable to anything especially enemy MG, nearby artillery, bombs and rockets and HE shrapnels, even 7.62 mm MGs can damage critical parts like the engine or transmission\n* Has difficulty penetrating most enemy tanks frontally, for example Pz.II, [[B1 bis]]\n* Reload time is rather long, stopping it from firing back in critical times\n* Poor off-road mobility and climbing ability makes it slow on hills\n* The four canons fire synchronously, which reduces the chances to hit an aircraft\n* Gun platform turning and elevation rate are a bit slow (slow reaction, hard to follow close/fast targets)\n* Limited elevation of 45° limits its effectiveness against targets directly above it, for example dive bombers like [[Ju 87 B-2|Ju 87 B2]]* Driver blocks the gun in a frontal ~90° arc, may not be able to swing the hull around in time to combat sudden encounters\n\n== History ==\n<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction.

After the First World War Kegresse returned to France to work with Citroen to produce half-tracks for the French Army starting in the 1920s. By 1940, these unarmoured Kegresse-Citroen half-tracks (the P.17, P.19, P.107, and MCG variants) were used primarily for towing artillery, although a small number of closed-top half-track armoured cars (the P.16) were also in service. The P.7.T had been an earlier Kegresse model, built between 1925 and 1927. The French, who had created the first self-propelled anti-aircraft gun-truck back in 1913, would continue through the interwar period experimenting with various truck-mounted AA weapons like those shown in this model.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=fr_citroen_kegresse_p4t Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|PF2AVtHfWao|'''The Shooting Range #141 (April Fool's)''' - ''Metal Beasts'' section at 00:39 discusses the {{PAGENAME}}.|EI7InCamqQ0|'''P4T AA Tank Review''' - ''NUSensei''}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n;Other vehicles of similar configuration and role\n\n* [[M13 MGMC]]\n* [[GAZ-AAA (DShK)]]\n\n== External links ==\n''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.''\n\n{{France anti-aircraft vehicles}}\n[[Category:Half-tracks]]"}}
