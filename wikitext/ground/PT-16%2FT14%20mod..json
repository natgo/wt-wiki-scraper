In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a gift rank {{Specs|rank}} German medium tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced during [[Update \"Direct Hit\"]] as a reward for the [[wt:en/news/7350-event-export-order-en|2021 Export Order]] event.\n\nThe PT-16/T14 mod. is a Leopard 2 prototype (like the Leopard 2K). It differs from the earlier prototype by its different turret more reminiscent of the production version, no remote-controlled 20 mm cannon, and an extremely fast autoloading cannon.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection.

With its poor armour protection and large frontal ammo rack, taking this tank into a head-on fight is often very dangerous, but it can be a very dangerous run-and-gun tank if the driver has quick reflexes and good target acquisition. \n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness.

This led to equally many different prototype designs being tested. Among these experimental versions was the Leopard chassis with the PT-14 turret, developed by Krauss-Maffei in the early 1980s. \n\nThe peculiarity of this design was the presence of an autoloading mechanism for the cannon, giving it an extremely high rate of fire. Despite undergoing exhaustive tests in Germany, the autoloader wasn’t adopted in the final design of the Leopard 2 and the concept remained just a prototype.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=germ_leopard_2_pt14 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|0eRNZAtbM4Y|'''Should You Grind The PT-16/T14? - Vehicle Review''' - ''Sako Sniper''}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n* [[Leopard 2K]]\n* [[Type 90]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wt:en/news/7343-development-export-order-pt-16-t14-mod-en|[Devblog] “Export Order”: PT-16/T14 mod]]\n\n{{Germany medium tanks}}"}}
