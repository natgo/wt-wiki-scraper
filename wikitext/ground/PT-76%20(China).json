It was introduced in [[Update 1.91 \"Night Vision\"]].\n\nIt is an early version of the Soviet PT-76B, with no stabilizer and a worse turret traverse speed.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members.

Avoid tanks with access to heavy machine guns on their turrets such as most American tanks, the [[IS-2 (1944)]], etc. This vehicle has next to no armour due to its amphibious abilities and can be easily destroyed even by machine guns.\n\nAlso, keep well clear of enemy SPAA. 12.7 mm guns and above will absolutely wreck this tank. In particular, the Wirbelwind is a significant threat. It has good penetration at range and will literally saturate the vehicle with autocannon shells. Just a short burst from the quad 20 mm guns will finish the PT-76 off.\n\n=== Mobility ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}\n<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle.

In order to defeat heavy/medium tanks, watch them and fire when they are not aiming or focusing on you. Use the light tank's manoeuvrability and fire rate to deliver pin-point hits onto the enemy's flanks, then retreat back in to cover before they can get a fix on the firing location. The PT-76 is also helpful in scouting enemy positions for its allies so they can bring in more firepower. As previously mentioned, this tank does not have the armour nor the crew to take on enemies head-on, so try to remain stealthy. It functions great as a scout tank in [[Simulator Battles]].\n\nWhile the PT-76 has amphibious capabilities, it is not necessary to use them all the time. Keep in mind that the PT-76 can only go about 10 km/h in the water, so utilize the ability to travel on land as well. Instead, use the water to make an escape or take a shortcut. As an example, drive into the water if an enemy has spotted you, and take cover behind an off-shore rock. Driving through a river to flank the enemy is also possible if a bridge is not nearby. Take caution that reversing in the water is slow, if not nonexistent, which may get the PT-76 stuck if driven into an obstacle. Also make sure to check the map, as some maps like ''Eastern Europe'' have rivers with no way to get back onto land, or at least not many.\n\nOtherwise, avoid directly confronting an enemy. Instead, take cover and scout. Another good tactic to use is watching the enemy - find a spot where they can't engage you and watch them. Wait for the right moment; when the enemy is reloading, aiming somewhere else, not noticing the PT-76, is attacking an ally, etc, quickly check to make sure no other enemy can target you and send a shell towards your enemy! Try to snipe at the enemy, but make sure to avoid '''all''' enemy fire, as all tanks can penetrate the PT-76's armour (even the [[GAZ-AAA (4M)]] technically has enough penetration to get through the tank's rear armour!).\n\nThe amphibious capabilities are a huge helper to the vehicle, allowing it to reach unusual sniper areas that vehicles without said capabilities could not reach (e.g. hiding behind the rocks near the jetty on Normandy). Make sure to relocate after knocking out enemies or being spotted, however, as they will know the PT-76's location and likely broadcast it to other players, most often resulting in the PT-76 being destroyed.\n\nThe HEAT-FS shell is powerful in terms of penetration, but the post-penetration damage is lacking compared to other Soviet shells. Not to say that the BK-350M is weak (it's actually quite amazing for a HEAT shell), but oftentimes, 2 or more shots will be needed to destroy an enemy, particularly the more spacey vehicles like the Tiger 1 and Panther. It would be wise, therefore, to look up crew and module locations on enemy vehicles in order to make your shots as lethal as possible.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as \"bad\", \"good\" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as \"inadequate\" and \"effective\".'' -->\n\n'''Pros:'''\n\n* Good mobility, amphibious\n* Powerful HEAT-FS round\n* Has access to scouting\n* Low profile\n* Much better gun elevation/depression speed than the Soviet [[PT-76B]]\n\n'''Cons:'''\n\n* Lacks the two-plane stabilizer of the Soviet PT-76B, hard to fire on the move or in water\n* Very poor armour, vulnerable to heavy machine gunfire\n* Stock APCR round has disappointing angled performance and post-penetration damage\n* Easy target for aircraft\n* Susceptible to overpressure damage\n* Looks very similar to the Soviet PT-76B (gun barrel is slightly different), can be confused for it in Simulator Battles\n\n== History ==\n<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction.

The first prototype, known as the WZ-221 or Type 60, was tested in 1959 and the final design was approved in December 1963. The final design had the factory designation WZ-211 and entered production as the Type 63. Upgraded variants of the Type 63 are still in service with the PLA as of 2021.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=cn_pt_76 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|YYkmREFrcC0|'''PT 76 - No Expert Crew Challenge''' - ''Napalmratte''|SJoW-2_6J6o|'''Amphibious tanks'''  discusses the {{PAGENAME}} at 4:38  - ''War Thunder Official Channel''}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n;Other vehicles of similar configuration and role\n\n* [[Type 63-I]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wikipedia:PT-76|[Wikipedia] PT-76]]\n* [https://tanks-encyclopedia.com/coldwar/USSR/soviet_PT-76.php <nowiki>[Tanks Encyclopedia]</nowiki> PT-76 light tank (1952)]\n\n{{China light tanks}}"}}
