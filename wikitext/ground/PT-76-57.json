In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium gift rank {{Specs|rank}} Soviet light tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced during [[Update \"Direct Hit\"]] as a reward for [[Battle Pass: Season V, \"River Hunter\"]].\n\nOtherwise known as the PT-76E, the PT-76-57 possesses many significant upgrades, including night vision and a two-plane stabiliser. The main difference is the armament, a rapid firing AU-220 57 mm cannon fitted in a unique turret which, using the same BR-281 shells used in the [[ZSU-57-2]], proves very effective when dealing with numerous enemies at once. Compared to the ZSU-57-2 due to the similar armament, the PT-76-57 makes up having only half the firepower by instead having a significantly faster rate of fire. On a relatively mobile and low-profile chassis, the PT-76-57 can be a true menace on the battlefield when flanking otherwise heavily-armoured foes or tearing through lightly-armoured IFVs and light tanks.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->\nOverall, armour is extremely weak. You cannot rely on the armour to save you in any circumstance, as almost everything in the BR bracket can penetrate you at any angle, and at any range. The turret face averages around 35 mm of armour, the upper and lower glacis averages between 23 mm and 45 mm, and the sides are extremely weak, at only 13 mm of armour. The frontal armour and the angles will only protect you from heavy machine guns. Even light machine guns can penetrate your vehicle from the side, so if you disable an enemy's main gun, be sure to avoid showing your vulnerable sides to enemy machine gun fire.\n\n'''Armour type:'''\n\n* Rolled homogeneous armour\n* Cast homogeneous armour (gun mantlet)\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Give advice on how to use them and how to fill the ammunition storage.'' -->\n{{main|AU-220 (57 mm)}}\n\nThe AU-220 cannon is extremely effective in the BR bracket, as it can destroy any light tank at ranges up to 2.5 km, most medium tanks up to 2 km, and can reliably destroy heavies using weak spot sniping from 1.5 km. In CQB, the cannon is devastating, and the 20 g of TNT filler in the round ensure catastrophic damage from a successful penetration. The cannon performs best in CQB, or at ranges of less than ~1 km. At long range, use your laser rangefinder and pinpoint weak spots, or aim for the vulnerable sides. Some things to consider remain, though, like the relatively low muzzle velocity of the round, the low penetration at ranges beyond 2 km, and the fact that you cannot reliably destroy heavies frontally. Unlike most tanks, it thrives best in an uptier, where you face early MBTs with poor armour. Plus, the cramped crew compartments of these MBTs allow for consistent single-shot knock-outs from the sides.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"100%\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"6\" | [[AU-220 (57 mm)|57 mm AU-220]] || colspan=\"5\" | Turret rotation speed (°/s) || colspan=\"4\" | Reloading rate (seconds)\n|-\n!

In smaller maps, try to avoid face-to-face confrontations with heavy tanks, as it will quickly get your vehicle destroyed. Instead, try to secure a good position near a cap point, or flank to a side route to surprise passing tanks. As a support tank, stick with friendly tanks, scouting and helping to repair as needed. Disable tanks for allies to finish when you can't, and destroy more lightly armoured targets. This tank performs exceptionally well as a flanker as well, as it is fairly mobile and can easily take out tanks from the sides. If a more aggressive playstyle suits you better, rush a capture point, find a secure position, and destroy enemies pushing into it.\n\n;Notable enemies\n\n* [[T26E5]], [[T34]], [[T32 Heavy Tank (Family)|T32]] - These American heavies cannot be taken out frontally quickly enough to avoid return fire. Either flank the sides to cook the ammo, or disable and let allies pick them off.\n* [[M46]], [[M60 (Family)|M60]] - These American mediums are abundant at this BR, and cannot be reliable penetrated from the front. Disable the main gun and mobility first, then shoot the cupola to incapacitate ~ 2 crew members. If it is safe to push, get a sideshot for a crew knockout or ammo. Make sure not to expose your sides to machine guns.\n* [[M48 Patton (Family)|M48]] series - These tanks can be penetrated frontally, or from the side, or the rear of the turret. However, with powerful weaponry and decent armour, they can easily disable your vehicle. Most of them also have rangefinders, so distance is not a sure way to protect yourself.\n* [[SPz BMP-1]], [[BMP-1]] - These fast, mobile light tanks can easily take out enemies with the 73 mm anti-tank gun, or their missiles. Luckily, they are easy to take out, as 1-2 rounds will usually either destroy the ammo or knockout the small crew.\n* [[Tiger II (Family)|Tiger II]] - This tank is heavily armoured, has a powerful gun, and excellent survivability. Ideally, you only face them from the side, where you can easily penetrate. However, from the front, you need to go in this order: Disable the main gun, then break a track, and then knockout crew by shooting the commanders cupola. This will incapacitate at least 2 turret crew members.\n* [[Kugelblitz]] and [[Wiesel 1A4]] - These German AA's can shred you from any angle and most ranges, so beware. However, you can destroy them just as easily, so be aware of your surroundings. The Wiesel is exceptionally dangerous because of its mobility and small size, so it can take key positions and show up behind friendly lines quickly.\n* [[Marder A1-]] and [[DF105]] - The Marder has missiles and a rapid fire autocannon - two things that don't match with the PT-76-57 very well. The DF105 has a powerful HEAT-FS round that will one shot you instantly. Again, powerful light tanks are a major threat and a top priority.\n* [[Centurion Mk.5 AVRE]] - This HESH lobbing medium tank is one of your most dangerous enemies, because even a hit NEAR your tank will cause destruction by overpressure. However, the long reload makes it extremely vulnerable for an extended period of time, and a penetrated  commander cupola will incapacitate turret crew members. Make sure to disable the barrel first, though, or you will see the hanger screen very quickly.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness.

If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block \"/History\" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template.

This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->\n\nIn the early 2000s, the issue of increasing the combat effectiveness of the numerous, but outdated PT-76's was proposed to be solved in a very non-trivial way. Engineers of the Nizhny Novgorod design bureau \"Burevestnik\" combined the 57 mm automatic gun developed in the USSR at the end of the 70's with a mechanized ammunition rack, combining this in a combat module for a specially created turret for light tanks of the PT-76 series. While considering possible ways to re-equip old amphibious tanks with a new weapon, the small-caliber automatic cannon, although it was inferior to other variants of larger calibers in terms of armour penetration, gained a lot in terms of the burst weight to time ratio, as well as in possible applications - from destroying armoured vehicles (including a modern MBT when hit to the side) to fighting helicopters.\n\nThe AU-220 module itself, built on the basis of the Soviet S-60 anti-aircraft gun, has already been proposed for the fleet in the form of a remotely controlled shipborne mounting. For use on armoured vehicles, the module was equipped with a modern fire control system with night vision devices and a laser rangefinder. The prototype PT-76 with a 57 mm gun, remained at a stage as a working prototype, however, the AU-220M module continues to exist as a promising solution for the latest vehicles in the Russian army.\n\n''- From [[wt:en/news/7389-development-battle-pass-vehicles-pt-76-57-en|Devblog]]''\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=ussr_pt_76_57 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|hSLQiy5cnbk|'''The Shooting Range #280''' - ''Metal Beasts'' section at 00:27 discusses the {{PAGENAME}}.}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wt:en/news/7389-development-battle-pass-vehicles-pt-76-57-en|[Devblog] Battle Pass vehicles: PT-76-57]]\n\n{{USSR light tanks}}\n{{USSR premium ground vehicles}}"}}
