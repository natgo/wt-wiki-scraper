It still can be used to ping targets as a rangefinding help or to mow down minor obstacles blocking your line of sight.\n\n== Usage in battles ==\n<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a \"guide\" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\nAs with all other Panther-series medium tanks, it is best played in a supporting role or as a front-line offensive tank due to its agility. The cannon is more than forgiving and powerful enough to destroy any potential target, so use it to an advantage; long-range shooting is effective as the muzzle velocity is extremely high, owing to the long-barreled 75 mm, the penetration values are more than capable of punching through any opposing armour, and the shell weight will, if the shell penetrates, consistently deal decent amounts of crew and module damage, if not immediately make the target on combat ineffective.\n\nThis tank, however, owing to its \"mailbox\" gun mantlet design, is not a good combatant frontally, especially at its BR; many enemy tanks will find the gun mantlet a juicy target. Never engage in extended frontal skirmishes with enemy tanks; instead, use the high mobility as much as possible. Don't stay in one place as much as possible, shoot and scoot before the enemy can react shoot through the mantlet.\n\nAnother thing to note: the only difference between this and the German Panther G is the absence of side skirts and the thicker lower part of the mantlet, as well as the French markings on the side of the gun mantlet and the tank's name at the hull rear. This is useful in Simulator battles because if you were to put German markings over the French ones you may just pass as a German tank. Take that as you will and warn the people on your team not to shoot you.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as \"bad\", \"good\" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as \"inadequate\" and \"effective\".'' -->\n\n'''Pros:'''\n\n* Excellent cannon with great stock AP for common targets (eg. [[Tiger H1]], [[Pz.IV H]] and [[M4A3E2]]) and HE for light vehicles. Great accuracy and velocity allows easy long-range sniping. Plenty of ammo capacity means flexible ammo setups.\n* Heavily armoured frontal hull is immune to most guns like the 75 mm Kwk 40, 88 mm L/56 and 76 mm M1.\n* Fast top speed and good hull traverse. Can get to positions in time.\n* Adequate gun depression of -8° adapts most terrains well.\n* Has RP and SL bonus due to it being premium\n* Does not face threatening opponents (eg. [[IS-2 (Family)|IS-2]]) as much as the German one would, increasing survivability\n\n'''Cons:'''\n\n* Gun mantlet is only 100 mm, a huge and '''well-known''' weakspot to shoot at. 76mm Sherman, Pz.IV G / H / J, [[Tiger H1]] can easily penetrate it.\n* Side ammo racks are prone to detonation when hit.\n* Terrible reverse speed of only -4 km/h, can get the player killed.\n* No access to APCR meaning it struggles to deal with tanks encountered in a uptier like [[Ho-Ri Production|Ho-Ri]], Tiger II(H) and [[Ferdinand]].\n* Very identical appearance to the German Panthers, and can get hit by friendly fire a lot in simulator mode\n* Weak side armour gets penetrated easily by Russian APHEBC (mixed battle). Cannot angle too much.\n* Lower glacis often catches fire or brakes transmission when penetrated, leaving the tank immobile and vulnerable.\n* High profile for a medium tank makes it harder to hide.\n* Weak roof armour is vulnerable to strafers like IL-2 (Germany) or Hs-129 B3\n* Although heavily armoured, it can still get frontally penetrated by common British tanks like the [[Sherman Firefly]].\n\n== History ==\n<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block \"/History\" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template.

This program was led by the Captain Besnier who succeeded to form a little tank brigade of almost 20 old panzers: mostly Panzer IVs but also 2 Panthers and even 2 Tigers. The \"Commando Besnier\" fought during the encirclement of Saint-Nazaire, the last city still under German control on the 11 of May 1945 and then took part in the French Occupation of Germany at the end of the war. Some of the tanks have been attributed to the 3rd Armored Division at the end of 1945 and were kept mobilized for some months before being replaced. Some of the models have been given to museum (the Tiger can be seen in the museum of Saumur in France).\n\nNicknames after French regions have been given to every Besnier's tanks: Tiger \"Colmar\", Tiger \"Bretagne\", Panther \"Dauphiné\".\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicleCountry=france&vehicleType=tank&vehicleClass=medium_tank&vehicle=fr_pzkpfw_V_panther_dauphine Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|AEW7aFVCvmo|'''French Panthers''' discusses the {{PAGENAME}} - ''War Thunder Official Channel''|WoLatpmJuTA|'''Should You Buy: {{PAGENAME}}''' - ''ConeOfArc''|PUwSXP04-9Q|'''{{PAGENAME}} - Tank Review''' - ''Napalmratte''}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n;Vehicles equipped with the same chassis\n* [[Panzer V Panther (Family)]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n* Braeuer, Luc.
