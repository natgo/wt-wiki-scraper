In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' ('''{{Specs|pseudonym}}''') is a rank {{Specs|rank}} German medium tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced during the Closed Beta Test for Ground Forces before [[Update 1.41]]. As of [[Update 1.91 \"Night Vision\"]], it became the last Panther in the German tech tree due to the removal of the [[Panther II]].\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat?

However, the biggest and most noticeable change is seen in the turret design. Instead of the transverse-cylindrical mantlet of the [[Panther D|D]] and [[Panther A|A]] models or the chinned mantlet of the [[Panther G|G]] model, the Panther F features a brand new trapezoidal turret named the ''Schmalturm'' (or \"Narrow Turret\"). This new turret features a bevy of positives over its previous iterations, including beefier armour and the removal of the prominent shot trap caused by the cylindrical nature of the previous model's mantlet.  Although this new turret is a welcome addition, it is not without its weaknesses. The Panther will occasionally be facing enemies that can and will penetrate its turret from the front, namely the [[M26]], [[T26E1-1]], [[Tiger II (P)|Tiger II]], [[IS-2 (1944)|IS-2]], [[Tortoise]], [[AMX M4]].\n\n=== Mobility ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}\n<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->\n\n{{tankMobility|abMinHp=930|rbMinHp=531}}\n\nAs expected of the Panther series, it features excellent mobility as a result of its very high power to weight ratio. However its mobility has been toned down a few notches due to the limiting of the engine to improve engine lifespan, which is unfortunately useless as reliability has no function in War Thunder. It is also important to note that the reverse has not improved from its lethargic 3 km/h, but the Panther's ability to neutral turn helps tremendously when trying to escape.\n\n=== Modifications and economy ===\n{{Specs-Economy}}\n\n== Armaments ==\n{{Specs-Tank-Armaments}}\n=== Main armament ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Weapon|1}}\n<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun.

Although not as effective as the later legendary [[KwK43 (88 mm)|KwK43]], it's enough to penetrate most enemies it will face, resulting in many two-shot kills with the help of the PzGr 39's explosive filler. The penetration combined with the excellent accuracy makes it an ideal sniping cannon.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"100%\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" | [[KwK44 (75 mm)|75 mm KwK44]] || colspan=\"5\" | Turret rotation speed (°/s) || colspan=\"4\" | Reloading rate (seconds)\n|-\n!

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\n\nThe Panther is a great \"hunter,\" locating weak (slow, damaged, or alone) tanks and taking them out is by far its greatest capability. Mobility is a big advantage and the tanker should use it to their advantage, especially when fighting  higher-rank vehicles. You should find a suitable location as soon as possible; when you do this, you can easily push off advancing enemy tanks while heavier allies join the action. Just when you notice that you have strong opposition it is time to retreat. Your role is not to fight directly but rather spot weaknesses in the enemy defence. Once you learn how to take advantage of its speed and gun, you'll easily take out enemy targets by surprise.\n\nDespite its slower turret traverse speed and mobility over the Panther A, it receives better turret armour, a rangefinder and faster reload.\n\nMost of the heavy tanks that the Panther faces are not fast enough to counter its attacks. However, this does not mean that they are harmless. Be careful when approaching the enemy and always try to have the advantage. It is not advised to attack enemy heavy tanks directly or frontally; this is where they have most of their armour, and the Panther will probably not be able to penetrate it. It is better to retreat and try to find an alternative route before engaging the enemy.\n\nThe Panther has no anti-air capabilities, so it is best to find cover if there are enemy aircraft nearby that are equipped with bombs or rockets.\n\nIf the map allows it and you prefer this kind of playstyle, the Panther F also excels at sniping. Although having a slower turret traverse speed and mobility compared to the the Panther A, the F version trades it for better turret armour, a rangefinder and faster reload. The distance will make your armour almost impenetrable to a lot of guns while being able to use the rangefinder, high muzzle velocity and great optics to pick off enemies.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness.

F variant. This version had stronger front armor on its hull (80 mm), its sides (50 mm), and the front part of its roof (25 mm). The Schmalturm 605 turret, developed by the company Daimler-Benz AG, was slightly smaller than the standard Panther turret. This allowed the forward armor to be reinforced up to 120 mm, at an inclination of 20°. The sides of the new turret had a thickness of 60 mm and an inclination of 25°, and the thickness of the gun mantlet reached 150 mm. Stereoscopic rangefinders produced by the company Zeiss were mounted on the sides of the turret. The vehicle was armed with a 75 mm KwK 42/1 L/70 or KwK 44/1 L/70 gun in a new mantlet.\n\nA project was launched to equip the Panther with the longer 75 mm KwK L/100. Instead of a directional machine gun, the radio operator/gunner used an MP 44 assault rifle. Production plans stipulated that production Ausf. F tanks would only be released with road wheels with internal shock absorbers. During mass production, the tank was supposed to be fitted with a periscope sight with an optical stabilizer. Each tank could, if necessary, be equipped with an FG 1250 night vision device.\n\nIn October 1944, production of the Ausf. F was set to launch in the Daimler-Benz plant in Berlin in March 1945. But by January 1945, a single Panther Ausf. G prototype with a Schmallturm turret was ready. Due to the overall difficulty of Germany's situation at the time, only a few prototypes with a narrow turret and 8 tank hulls had been constructed by the end of the war. Some sources indicate that several Ausf. F variants were completed by Daimler-Benz between April 20 and 23, 1945, and they may have been used in combat operations.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicleCountry=germany&vehicleType=tank&vehicleClass=medium_tank&vehicle=germ_pzkpfw_V_ausf_f_panther Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n== See also ==\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.''\n\n{{Germany medium tanks}}"}}
