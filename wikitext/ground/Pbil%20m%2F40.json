In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium gift rank {{Specs|rank}} Swedish light tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced during [[Update \"Direct Hit\"]] as a reward for the [[wt:en/news/7350-event-export-order-en|2021 Export Order]] event.\n\nThe Pbil m/40 is an armoured car with a 20 mm autocannon. It has light armour but a large 6-person crew, and the ability to go the same speed forward and backwards. Its speed allows it to get into objectives and flanking position quickly, which allows it to strike the weak side of tanks, offsetting the relatively low penetration of its rounds.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->\n\n'''Armour type:'''\n* Rolled homogeneous armour\n* Wheel (tires)\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Take advantage of your 20 mm cannon's high rate of fire to quickly dispose of unaware tanks. If you are engaging someone in CQC, you should try to take out their gunner or barrel before trying to finish your enemy off, although you should be able to penetrate most enemy tanks frontally. You can also utilise its speed to reach capture points early before attacking the enemy, which will also help your team as you are essentially scouting for them when they catch up to you.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness.

Developed under the name ‘Lynx’, three of the 18 units ordered were already shipped to Denmark before the outbreak of WWII. However, after the outbreak of hostilities, Sweden placed an export ban on all military equipment and the remaining Lynx armored cars remained in Sweden.\n\nSubsequently, the Swedish military commissioned the remaining vehicles into its own service under the designation Pansarbil m/39 while already issuing an order for 30 more vehicles to be built. Part of this order was licensed out to Volvo, with these vehicles receiving the designation Pansarbil m/40. The vehicles remained in Swedish service until 1958 before being decommissioned and sold off to the Dominican Republic where the last units remained in service until the mid 1990’s.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=sw_pbil_m40 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wt:en/news/7348-development-export-order-pansarbil-m-40-en|[Devblog] \"Export Order\": Pansarbil m/40]]\n\n{{TankManufacturer AB Landsverk}}\n{{Sweden light tanks}}\n{{Sweden premium ground vehicles}}\n[[Category:Wheeled ground vehicles]]"}}
