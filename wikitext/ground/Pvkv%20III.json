In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Swedish tank destroyer {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update \"Danger Zone\"]].\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->\nLike the [[Pvkv II]], the Pvkv III shares its hull with the [[Strv m/41 S-II|Strv m/41]], and as such has acceptable hull armour for its BR. However, due to the incredibly thin turret armour which is unlikely to resist the .50 cals found on many vehicles it will face, it is not recommended to fight head-on.\n\nThe floor armour in the turret combined with the gun placement makes anything but the largest HE, APHE, and HEAT unlikely to incapacitate the turret and hull crew in one shot, allowing the machine gunner and driver to retreat and repair. Due to this, a hull-down position is recommended.\n\n'''Armour type:'''\n\n* Rolled homogeneous armour\n* Cast homogeneous armour (gun mantlet)\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Armour !!

However, as the state budget didn't allow for the procurement of completely new units, the military resorted to converting existing chassis into new vehicles. As a result, a range of experimental vehicles were hastily designed and tested to act as a stopgap measure until more modern equipment could be acquired.\n\nAmong these vehicles was the Pvkv III - a Strv m/41 converted into a tank destroyer by having its old turret replaced with a new one, housing a dedicated 57 mm anti-tank cannon. Differing only from the Pvkv II - a vehicle we already covered in one of our previous articles - by the weapon choice and by the intention to act as a stopgap itself for the Pvkv II until its production could be ramped up, all vehicles underwent testing in the early 1950s. Despite proving itself as a capable vehicle during these tests, the Swedish military soon adopted the Strv 81 into service, making further work on the project redundant and thus leading to the project's cancellation soon thereafter.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.''\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wt:en/news/7687-development-pvkv-iii-swedish-pop-head-en|[Devblog] Pvkv III: Swedish Pop-Head]]\n\n{{TankManufacturer AB Landsverk}}\n{{Sweden tank destroyers}}"}}
