Because of the success of those platforms, Sweden decided to create a tank destroyer similar in concept to the StuG's. Landsverk created a design in 1942, based on the chassis of the [[Strv m/42 EH|Strv m/42]]. It was chosen by the Swedish military and was given the designation Pansarvärnskanonvagn m/43, or '''Pvkv m/43''' for short.\n\nThe Pvkv m/43 used the chassis of the Strv m/42, but with a casemate superstructure replacing the turret. The superstructure was located at the front of the vehicle, and the glacis was sloped. It had an open tarp to keep the weight down, and used a tarp to protect the crew from the elements. The Pvkv m/43 had a crew of 4, and was initially armed with a 75mm luftvärnskanonen m/36 antiaircraft gun, modified with a longer barrel for increased armour penetration. The gun could traverse 15 degrees to the left and right. It had a Ksp m/39 machine gun as the secondary armament. It was powered by a Volvo A8B engine producing 360 hp. The gearbox was different than the gearbox of the Strv m/42, and the drive wheels had to be reinforced to handle the increased weight of the vehicle. The Swedish military ordered 87 Pvkv m/43 in 1942, but deliveries were delayed and the last vehicle was delivered in 1948.\n\nIn 1954, the vehicle was given an armoured roof to better protect the crew. Other improvements included a muzzle brake, a gun travel lock, and a bore evacuator/fume extractor. The Strv m/41 was retired from service in 1957, which allowed the two Scania-Vabis L603 engines per vehicle to be used in the Pvkv m/43. The two L603  engines produced less horsepower (320 hp) than the Volvo A8B, but were much more reliable. In 1970, the Pvkv m/43 was retired from service, and the guns were used in static fortifications until 1995.\n\n== Media ==\n''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.''\n\n== See also ==\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n\n* Pansarvärnskanonvagn m/43.
