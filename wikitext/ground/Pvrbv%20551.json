In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Swedish tank destroyer {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.97 \"Viking Fury\"]].\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->\nThe survivability of the {{PAGENAME}} is entirely designed for rifle-calibre fire. The chassis is surrounded by plates varying between 5 and 25 mm of thickness, with the front angled to somewhat protect against machine-gun bullets. The {{PAGENAME}} is otherwise entirely exposed to all forms of weaponry, and is expected to be kept behind cover because of this. The launcher is external, and fired by a very exposed launcher and gunner. This means the {{PAGENAME}} has to put distance between itself and the opponent in order to not get knocked out immediately. Ideally, the chassis should be positioned behind cover, only exposing the launcher itself, making it more difficult for enemies to locate the vehicle. \n\n'''Armour type:''' <!-- The types of armour present on the vehicle and their general locations -->\n<!-- Example: * Rolled homogeneous armour (Front, Side, Rear, Hull roof)\n* Cast homogeneous armour (Turret, Transmission area) -->\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->\n\n{{tankMobility|abMinHp=193|rbMinHp=120}}\n\nThe {{PAGENAME}} features a 136 hp engine giving the vehicle a speed of 38 km/h. This is a general downgrade in comparison to the [[UDES 33]], as the lesser horsepower makes it slower and less torque capable. The engine is also petrol, giving it a very high RPM compared to other vehicles. This makes it pretty loud, and distinct in sound compared to tanks around it. The {{PAGENAME}} isn't very good in reverse either, as the transmission only has one reverse gear. The neutral steering is good however, as the missile launcher can't fully traverse. This gives it a very comfortable handling when standing still, something the {{PAGENAME}} is meant for.\n\n=== Modifications and economy ===\n{{Specs-Economy}}\n\n== Armaments ==\n{{Specs-Tank-Armaments}}\n=== Main armament ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Weapon|1}}\n<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun. Assess its effectiveness in a battle based on the reloading speed, ballistics and the power of shells. Do not forget about the flexibility of the fire, that is how quickly the cannon can be aimed at the target, open fire on it and aim at another enemy. Add a link to the main article on the gun: <code><nowiki>{{main|Name of the weapon}}</nowiki></code>. Describe in general terms the ammunition available for the main gun. Give advice on how to use them and how to fill the ammunition storage.'' -->\n{{main|Rbs 55}}\n\nThe Rbs 55 is the same ATGM launcher found on the [[UDES 33]] but gets access to better munitions. The reload time is the same as the UDES so enemies will be able to replace their crew member quicker than your reload. It also gets less ammo, carrying only 8 rounds instead of 10. It is recommended to take a full ammo load as you will definitely run low during an extended battle. The firing angles are more restricted vertically, with only -13° compared to the UDES' -20°. It is horizontally restricted to the 4 o'clock right and 8 o'clock left positions.\n\nHowever, there is one big upgrade this launcher gets compared to the UDES; the ammunition. It starts off with the potent RB 55B (I-TOW) but can upgrade to the deadly RB 55C (TOW-2). The RB 55B is a good stock munition, being able to penetrate most, if not all, vehicles it faces within its BR range. However, the RB 55C is one of the best ATGMs at its BR range. With 800 mm of penetration, it has the ability to penetrate all vehicles at its BR and more. The slightly higher velocity makes it easier to hit long range targets before they can potentially drive into cover. It's also a Tier II modification so it can be unlocked relatively fast. This makes the launcher one of the most dangerous weapons to face at any range, provided the operator can stay alive, as the gunner is exposed from the waist up on the vehicle.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"100%\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" | [[Rbs 55]] ATGM || colspan=\"5\" | Turret rotation speed (°/s) || colspan=\"4\" | Reloading rate (seconds)\n|-\n!

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\n\nThe {{PAGENAME}} is very situational, as the vehicle requires a secure sightline, preferably with a lot of distance. The {{PAGENAME}} can be used in close engagement, when positioned behind teammates. But this is usually at the hope that your team will tank incoming shells for you. Since the reload is slow, and the launcher unable to fire on the move, the {{PAGENAME}} struggles to safely engage opponents safely without any cover. When used behind terrain, the vehicle can safely pull back after launching, and can be difficult to hit due to the small profile of the launcher.\n\nIdeally the {{PAGENAME}} should be played passively. By making use of the profile, the tank should try to stay hull-down while still maintaining a large sightline. Since the vehicle sports deadly ATGM missiles, the {{PAGENAME}} rarely struggles to penetrate from the front. This allows for more creativity, as the vehicle doesn't necessarily need to rely on flanks to deal damage. The vehicle also comes with smoke grenades stock. Although a single salvo, their spread and deploy speed are great, allowing the vehicle to safely retreat without giving the opponent time to react.\n\n{{Notice|Since the missile is easily guided, the Pvrbv 551 works well against helicopters! The missile has to hit the target directly however, as it only detonates on impact.}}\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness.

The Ikv 102 and Ikv 103, infantry support vehicles mounting a 105 mm gun, had become obsolete in the past few years. At the same time, the same companies were contracted to convert Ikv 102 and Ikv 103 vehicles into Lvrbv 701 surface-to-air missile carriers. The hull of the Ikv 102/Ikv 103 was plated over, in order to extend the crew compartment the full length of the vehicle. The engine was replaced by a Ford V-6 engine. The armament consisted of a TOW ATGM launcher in the center of the hull, which was raised up through a circular opening in the roof of the vehicle - covered by a two piece hatch - in order to fire the weapon. 55 Pvrbv 551 vehicles were delivered to the Swedish military.\n\n=== [[wt:en/news/6633-development-swedish-ground-vehicles-pvrbv-551-en|Devblog]] ===\nDuring the 1970's, the Swedish military came to realize that their anti-tank and anti-air regiments within the armored branch were substantially lacking in mobility and protection. As a result, studies were initiated in an effort to find potential solutions to this problem.\n\nDuring the conducted studies, it was found that the previously decommissioned Ikv 102 and 103 SPG's could relatively easily be converted into mobile ATGM and SAM platforms. This sparked the development of several projects in the late 1970's, all of which aimed to convert the old chassis into modern missile carriers.\n\nBy the early 1980's, the viability of this undertaking had already successfully been proven through the creation of several prototypes. However, the decision was then made to not simply convert the old chassis, but to substantially rebuild them in order to facilitate necessary improvements.\n\nBy the mid 1980's, the work was considered complete and two new vehicles were developed as a result - the Pvrbv 551 and Lvrbv 701 - the former being the ATGM carrier, whereas the latter represented the SAM variant. Both vehicles subsequently entered service with the Swedish military in the mid to late 1980's.\n\nIn total, 57 Ikv 103s were converted into the Pvrbv 551 missile carriers, which served with the Swedish military from 1984 until 2000, when the last of the operational units was retired from service.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=sw_pvrbv_551 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Images\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"150\">\nFile:Pvrbv 551 WTWallpaper 01.jpg|\nFile:Pvrbv 551 WTWallpaper 02.jpg|\nFile:Pvrbv 551 WTWallpaper 03.jpg|\nFile:Pvrbv 551 WTWallpaper 04.jpg|\nFile:Pvrbv 551 WTWallpaper 05.jpg|\nFile:Pvrbv 551 WTWallpaper 06.jpg|\n</gallery>\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n'''Similar Swedish tanks'''\n\n* [[UDES 33]]\n* [[Ikv 103]]\n* [[Lvrbv 701]]\n\n'''Comparable ATGM carriers'''\n\n* [[M113A1 (TOW)]] / [[M113A1 (TOW) (China)]]\n* [[CM25]]\n* [[Striker]]\n* [[RakJPz 2 (HOT)]]\n* [[IT-1]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wt:en/news/6633-development-swedish-ground-vehicles-pvrbv-551-en|[Devblog] Swedish Ground Vehicles: Pvrbv 551]]\n\n{{TankManufacturer Hagglund}}\n{{Sweden tank destroyers}}"}}
