In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} German light tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced during the Closed Beta Test for Ground Forces prior to Update 1.41.\n\nThe performance is similar to other low-rank German tanks, but the gun makes it stand out. With careful use, it is easily one of the best low-rank German tanks, but due to slow turret traverse and long reload between belts, it is just as easy to fail in.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->\nThe Panzer II F is slightly less protected than the Panzer II C coming before it, with 30 mm front plating on its turret and hull instead of the 35 mm on its predecessor. It still has only three crew, so it is easy to knock-out in one shot with most ammo types.\n\n'''Armour type:'''\n\n* Rolled homogeneous armour\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Armour !! Front !!

The II F uses the 20 mm KwK 38, which has almost double the fire rate compared to the KwK 30. The magazine size did not change, still limited to ten rounds of ammunition. The reload time is also identical, so while it is tempting to \"spray-n-pray\", it is more practical to use it like you would an autoloading tank at higher ranks and administer trigger control to make the shots count. With the Panzer II F, you do not have to worry about changing ammunition performance with every shot, which makes the \"autoloader-like\" playstyle more attractive, unlike similar-BR Italian tanks using 20 mm autocannons, the [[AB41]] and [[L6/40]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"100%\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"6\" | [[KwK38 (20 mm)|20 mm KwK38]] || colspan=\"5\" | Turret rotation speed (°/s) || colspan=\"4\" | Reloading rate (seconds)\n|-\n!

Decent enough versus light tanks and other vehicles from the rear. It inflicts underwhelming damage due to the lack of HE filler, yet still better than the PzGr 40.\n* '''PzGr 40:''' {{Annotation|HVAP-T|High-velocity armour-piercing tracer}} - Best penetrating shell of this vehicle. However, the damage effects are very poor. In close combat, snipe for modules and crew members for increased survival rate. Nothing is more annoying than emptying a clip and then to get out-gamed during the reload because the enemy gunner survived. Against angled armour it is not very effective like any other ACPR shell, this is offset by the very high base penetration though.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"100%\"\n! colspan=\"7\" | Penetration statistics\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" data-sort-type=\"text\" | Belt\n! colspan=\"6\" | Penetration @ 0° Angle of Attack (mm)\n|-\n! 10 m !! 100 m !! 500 m !! 1,000 m !! 1,500 m !! 2,000 m\n|-\n| Default || 37 || 34 || 23 || 14 || 9 || 6\n|-\n| PzGr || 37 || 34 || 23 || 14 || 9 || 6\n|-\n| PzGr 40 || 48 || 45 || 31 || 20 || 13 || 8\n|-\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"100%\"\n! colspan=\"10\" | Belt details\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" data-sort-type=\"text\" | Belt\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Type of<br>warhead\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Velocity<br>(m/s)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Projectile<br>Mass (kg)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Fuse delay<br>(m)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Fuse sensitivity<br>(mm)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Explosive Mass<br>(TNT equivalent) (g)\n! colspan=\"3\" | Ricochet\n|-\n! 0% !! 50% !! 100%\n|-\n| PzGr || API-T || 800 || 0.15 || N/A || N/A || N/A || 47° || 60° || 65°\n|-\n| PzGr 40 || HVAP-T || 1,050 || 0.10 || N/A || N/A || N/A || 66° || 70° || 72°\n|-\n|}\n\n==== [[Ammo racks]] ====\n[[File:Ammoracks_Pz.II_C.png|right|thumb|x250px|[[Ammo racks]] of the [[Pz.II C]] (identical).]]\n<!-- '''Last updated: 2.13.0.25''' -->\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\n\nThis tank is similar to the Panzer II C, an average light tank for lower ranks with decent armour and decent mobility, but a potent cannon. It does not work well against sloped armour due to the weak normalization of HVAP rounds. The higher rate of fire is quite punishing since it means that the typical player is continuously firing and reloading more often. If used like an autoloader tank from higher ranks, however, it becomes more accurate and effective. Do not get overconfident in this tank because your gun shoots fast and has excellent penetration; unfortunately, HVAP post-penetration damage is lacklustre here. Furthermore, the slightly higher battle rating means it can be pitted against the B1 ter, which it cannot reliably penetrate from the front or the side even when utilizing the HVAP belt.\n\nFurthermore, poor turret traverse means that a Stuart or BT can easily outmanoeuvre the tank. This relative difference is the same in both AB and RB/SB.\n\nFind a good position, be patient, and double-check before moving in. If you wish to brawl, have others covering your flanks to mitigate slow turret traverse.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness.

When stock it is useless against a B1 bis or M3/M5 (frontally)\n* Faster firerate than the previous C model can be punishing if you spray too much\n\n== History ==\n<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction.

This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->\n===Development===\nIn 1934, the development of the new German tanks, which would be the [[Pz.III E|Panzer III]] and [[Pz.IV E|Panzer IV]], was falling behind schedule despite an urgent need for tanks. As a stopgap solution until the designs were finalized, the Germany Army submitted a request for a new tank, designing it to Krupp, MAN, Henschel, and Daimler-Benz.\n\nThe product was a design based on the German Panzer I light tank, but it was larger with the addition of an extra bogie wheel and had a 20 mm autocannon as its main armament. The finished tank was designated the '''Panzer II''', and production started in 1935 but did not start delivering tanks until 18 months later. At this time, it was in a low rate production status by 1936 in the [[Pz.II C|'''Panzer II Ausf. C''']] variant. In the 1940s, the Panzer II was upgraded to the '''Panzer II Ausf. F''', which entered into production in 1941 with increased armour and a torsion bar suspension system. A total of 524 Ausf. F were produced between March 1941 to December 1942.\n\nThe Panzer II Ausf. F had a 35 mm front armour and 20 mm side armour compared to the 14 mm all-around armour on the Ausf. C. The 20 mm autocannon on the turret was the same, based off the 20 mm FlaK 30, then in use with a firing rate of 600 rpm from a 10-round magazine. The tank came with a coaxial machine gun as well. The turret was hand-cranked by the commander, who doubled as the gunner of the tanks. The crew of the Panzer II consists of three people, the driver, commander, and loader who doubled as a radio operator. The Panzer II Ausf. C could reach a speed of 33 mph with its torsion-bar suspension.\n\n===Combat usage===\nThe Panzer II would serve in the initial stages of World War II in the Battle of Poland, France. It continued serving in the North African Campaign and Operation Barbarossa as Germany's most numerous tank (By May 1940, there were about a thousand Panzer Is and IIs, but only 381 Panzer III and 290 Panzer IVs). By 1941, it was clear that the Panzer II was starting to become obsolete. With the increasing quantity of Panzer IIIs and IVs, the Panzer II was relegated to reconnaissance duties.\n\nDespite the up-armouring in the different Panzer II variants, the Panzer II could still be penetrated by the most towed anti-tank weapon in service at the time, leaving the crew at risk to enemy fire. By 1942, it was largely removed from front lines, and production ceased by 1943. The turrets of these obsolete tanks were used as gun turrets on defensive bunkers on the Atlantic Wall, and the chassis stayed in use for other purposes, such as a self-propelled gun and tank destroyer in the ''Wespe'' and ''Marder II'' respectively.\n\n=== In-game description ===\nThe Pz.Kpfw. II Ausf. F was the last production variant of the Pz.Kpfw. II tank. Serial production of the vehicle was meant to answer a need for new tank formations, as medium tanks were produced in very insufficient quantities. The design of the tank was similar to the Pz.Kpfw. II Ausf. C, except for the bent forward portion of the hull, which was made of 33 mm thick solid armour plating. The thickness of the frontal portion of the superstructure, turrets, and gun mantlet was increased to 30 mm. The armour thickness on the sides and stern was 15 mm. On the right side of the frontal portion of the tank's superstructure, a fake driver's viewport was installed. In addition, the driver received a KFF-2 surveillance device, which allowed a viewing angle of 63° and was protected by a two-hinged lid. A container for the crew's things was affixed to the rear of the turret.\n\nThe main section of the Pz.Kpfw. II Ausf. F was equipped with a new 20 mm 2 cm KwK38 automatic cannon with a TZF 3a sight. In addition to improvements in its weapons' ballistic performance, in 1940 the tank received the pointed armour-piercing Pzgr 40 L'Spur shell, with an armour-piercing core made of solid tungsten carbide alloy. These measures greatly increased its armour penetration capabilities. The ammunition on the latest series of tanks was increased to 180 shells and 2,100 rounds. The turret was equipped with an improved rotation mechanism and a new design for the gun mantlets' armoured viewports.\n\nFrom 1941 to 1942, the four companies MAN, Daimler-Benz, FAMO, and MIAG produced a total of 533 tanks.\n\nThe tank was used extensively until the end of 1942. Self-propelled anti-aircraft guns, tank destroyers, and flame tanks were designed using this variant as a base.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=germ_pzkpfw_II_ausf_F Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Sights\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/post/675135/en/ RideR2's Realistic gunsight (TZF4a, TZF 5a/b/d/e/f/f2, TZF 9b/b1/c/d, TZF 12/a) for Pzkpfw II, Pzkpfw III, Pzkpfw IV, Pzkpfw V, Pzkpfw VI]\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n* [[Pz.II C]]{{-}}[[Pz.II C (DAK)]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wt:en/news/2778/current/|[Vehicle Profile] PzKpfw II Ausf C/F and DAK]]\n\n{{Germany light tanks}}"}}
