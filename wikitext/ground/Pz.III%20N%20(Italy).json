It was introduced in [[Update \"Ixwa Strike\"]].\n\nThis is a Panzer III, upgraded to carry a short 75 mm KwK37 cannon, which can also be found on a number of [[Pz.IV (Family)|Panzer IV]] variants, as mounting the [[KwK40 (75 mm)|long 75 mm gun]] failed, so a compromise was made. Panzer III N is referred to as the assault variant of the Panzer III family, and it retains a body of the Panzer III L and M variants. A small amount would be used by the Italian Social Republic in the late stages of World War 2.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection.

As a brawler you'll essentially be one of the few people on your team leading the charge against the enemy team. Unlike other Italian tanks at a similar battle rating, you actually have somewhat of a reliable armour that can come in very useful when charging the enemy, especially by surprise due to the enemy being caught off-guard and likely misplacing their initial shot. Although its speed is not really the best, with powertrain and engine upgrades that improve the mobility of the tank, you should still be able to keep up fairly well on a flat surface. Protection-wise, make sure you angle your tank if you are not charging the enemy, this will increase your chances of survival. The main asset when playing in the brawler role is your 75 mm KwK37 cannon. This cannon can easily make short work with the majority of the enemies you'll be facing at your BR. Sadly, its stock rounds are not the best so new players might struggle to penetrate from time to time. Once you have unlocked the Hl.Gr 38C HEAT round, you'll be easily taking out enemies frontally. This again will aid you heavily when playing as a brawler. As a support tank, you'll be providing essential support for your team which will greatly increase your chances to get a victory. The support role can be played in many ways, for example some players prefer to get to a good vantage point at the start of the map, usually a place that overlooks key points of a map, such as a capture zones or enemy spawn points. Others prefer to stay behind the main line of tanks leading the charge, and coming in either to assist teammates in eliminating enemy vehicles or by flanking enemy positions to get the edge over them whenever you manage to spot them. It is also recommended that you bring either a back-up vehicle or a strike aircraft in the case you end up perishing during the fight. One of the main weaknesses of this tank is when you're detected or ranged by a tank or tank destroyer (assuming they have an angle that negates your cover's protection), your armour will not protect you from powerful guns. Your sides are the most vulnerable part of the vehicle, so always keep it in mind wherever you are going, as your average speed will make you an easy target for enemy snipers. Lastl but not least, keep in mind which game mode you are playing, as in Arcade Battles enemies can easily find out where you are located due to the name tag showing up above you, and are able to quickly find out where your weak spots are.   \n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness.

(2) .png|thumb|Pz.III N (Div.M.) during training]]\nThe history of Pz.Kpfw. III Ausf. N began in Germany of 1942, this variant was mainly an assault tank based on the Ausf. L and Ausf. M chassis, which was re-used to produce this tank. This variant was produced to meet the need for a stronger tank, one that could more effectively handle the Soviet T-34 and KV-1. There was also a desperate need for a special infantry support tank which would be used during advances alongside soldiers on the ground. It had a somewhat complicated development cycle, for example the widely used 75 mm long-barreled gun could not be installed in the turret due to the limited turret internal size. The German designers instead decided to use the short-barreled 7.5 cm KwK37 L/24 gun, which would be paired alongside with special hollow-charge shells. This explosive projectile packed more punch than the 5 cm KwK39 L/60 gun, so at the time it was favoured and underwent a series of trials, which were an overall success. Some design features of the tank had to be modified however, for example, the gun's mantlet was redesigned to accommodate the changes done. Other aspects of the vehicle also became better: the gun's recoil mechanisms were improved, the single-hinged hatch for the command turret was replaced with a two-hinged hatch, the thickness of the commander's cupola was increased to 100 mm. This variant's overall operational weight was around 23 tons. Most of the tanks received 5 mm side skirts (Schürzen) to protect the tank's hull and turret., however Italian variants, in Italian fashion, removed said side skirts. Production of the Pz.Kpfw. III Ausf. N tanks began in June 1942 and lasted until August 1943. A total of 700 of these tanks were built. 3 were built from Pz.Kpfw. III Ausf. J tanks, 447 from Pz.Kpfw. III Ausf. L tanks, 213 from Pz.Kpfw. III Ausf. M tanks, and 37 from other variants after they had returned from the front.\n[[File:Pz.III N (Div.M.) (1).png|thumb|Pz.III N (Div.M.) during training]]\nConcerning the Italian operational of this tank, Germany during the late stages of the second world war had supplied 12 units of Panzer IV G to Italy, which were placed in the Division \"M\" and, after the 25th of July, they were transferred to the 136th Armored Division \"Centauro II\". The 1st Armored Division Black Shirts \"M\" (for \"Mussolini\") was established starting from May of 1943, mainly starting from the very few survivors of the previous MVSN Battalions M who had been repatriated from the Russian front, this had to be done if there was hope for any new division being formed. The division was organised in 3 companies, the second company used 12 Panzer Kpfw III Ausf. N tanks, they were slightly modified however: they featured the 7.5 cm L/24 cannon, but something unique not previously installed on the same model, would be the smoke grenade launcher on the turret. As previously mentioned, they also removed the side skirts of the vehicle, and they were painted in a light tan color with the Divisione \"M\" logo painted onto the turret. They didn't see any action during the war, most of them were still undergoing training at the time. Most of the tanks ended up in Allied hands after the war. In conclusion, this tank variant earned a good reputation with the troops that had used it and by the beginning of the battle at the Kursk Bulge, the Wehrmacht and Waffen-SS owned 155 vehicles of this type. Some of the tanks were also transferred to Romania, Slovakia, and Croatia. Tanks of this variant were used until the end of the war and were transferred to Allied forces after Germany's surrender.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=it_pzkpfw_III_ausf_N Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|pKSAaUxvPE8|'''IXWA Strike - Panzer III N for Italy''' - ''8Bit Dane''}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.''\n\n{{Italy medium tanks}}"}}
