In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium rank {{Specs|rank}} German medium tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced during the Closed Beta Test for Ground Forces before [[Update 1.41]].\n\nThis is a Panzer III, upgraded to carry a short 75 mm KwK37 cannon, which can also be found on a number of [[Pz.IV F1|Panzer IV variants]], as mounting the [[KwK40 (75 mm)|infamous long variant]] of the 75 mm gun failed, so a compromise was made. Panzer III N is referred to as the assault variant of the Panzer III family, and it retains a body of the Panzer III L and M variants.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection.

III Ausf. N variant was an assault tank. Ausf. L and Ausf. M chassis were used to produce this variant. This variant was produced to meet the need for a stronger tank, one that could more effectively handle the Soviet T-34 and KV-1. A 75 mm long-barreled gun could not be installed in the turret due to the turret box's limited size. The designers decided to use the short-barreled 7.5cm KwK37 L/24 gun along with hollow-charge shells. This explosive projectile packed more punch than the 5 cm KwK39 L/60 gun. To accommodate this change, the gun's mantlet was redesigned. The gun's recoil mechanisms were improved, the single-hinged hatch for the command turret was replaced with a two-hinged hatch, and the thickness of the commander's cupola walls was increased to 100 mm. This variant's operational weight was 23,000 kg. Most of the tanks received a 5 mm Schürzen side skirts to protect the tank's hull and turret.\n\nProduction of Pz.Kpfw. III Ausf. N tanks began in June 1942 and lasted until August 1943. A total of 700 of these tanks were built. 3 were built from Pz.Kpfw. III Ausf. J tanks, 447 from Pz.Kpfw. III Ausf. L tanks, 213 from Pz.Kpfw. III Ausf. M tanks, and 37 from other variants after they had returned from the front.\n\nThis tank variant earned a good reputation with the troops and, by the beginning of the battle at the Kursk Bulge, the Wehrmacht and Waffen-SS owned 155 vehicles of this type.\n\nSome of the tanks was transferred to Romania, Slovakia, and Croatia. Tanks of this variant were used until the end of the war and were transferred to Allied forces after Germany's surrender.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=germ_pzkpfw_III_ausf_N Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the aircraft;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n;[[Panzer III (Family)|Related development]]\n* [[Pz.III N (Italy)]]\n\n== External links ==\n''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.''\n\n{{Germany medium tanks}}\n{{Germany premium ground vehicles}}"}}
