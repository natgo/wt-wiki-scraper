In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium rank {{Specs|rank}} German heavy tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.55 \"Royal Armour\"]].\n\nThe Pz.Kpfw. Churchill is a German captured [[Churchill Mk III]] in the German tech tree. It has virtually no differences to its British tech-tree counterpart, other than being painted grey (with the same tone as the Panzer IV and Panzer III).\n\nThe Pz.Kpfw. Churchill is one of the best heavy tanks in rank III, sporting heavy frontal armour, a 6 pounder gun that is suitable for its rank, and 30 smoke grenades that are fired separately from the roof, great for covering great areas with smoke. The Churchill also has great gun depression and turret traverse, meaning it can fire at different targets very efficiently.\n\nThis vehicle has a few weaknesses which are important to be aware of before charging into battle. First is its low acceleration with a maximum speed of only 24.9 km/h, so it's merely jogging speed as opposed to charging. The tank is also very bulky, difficult to manoeuvre, and a large target. Combine those weaknesses with thin roof armour, and this tank becomes the perfect prey for fighter-bombers and rocket attacks. The side armour is not as strong as its frontal armour, meaning it is vulnerable to flanking.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->\n\nThere are very few enemies which can successfully penetrate the Churchill, the [[M10 GMC|M10]] and the [[Achilles]] can quickly take care of this vehicle even at long ranges! Other tanks like the [[Jagdpanzer IV]], the [[Jagdpanzer 38(t)]], and the [[Dicker Max]] can also make quick work of the Churchill, but only in arcade battles, as in realistic battles, they all belong in the same tree.\n\n=== Mobility ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}\n<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle.

Though in urban environments, you should be careful in case someone tries to flank your weak side and rear armour.\n\nThis tank can be effectively be played in a brawling style, going into the front lines. This tank, due to its excellent armour and gun, can even hold off an entire enemy flank with minimal backup. In city maps, be careful not to expose your side armour as it is quite weak and your engine might get damaged. With its good gun, it can be as a support tank as well, in the second line destroying tanks. Angle your armour to maximize its effectiveness. When frontally angled, even the sides will be tough to penetrate. Many tanks will struggle penetrating you. There are some tanks that you don't even need to worry at all penetrating you from the front, such as the Panzer III. Angling your armour will make you even tough against the high penetration Panzer IV F2. However, be aware of higher penetration tanks. The M10 is a worthy mention as most of the time it might be able to penetrate your armour. The far deadlier Achilles can penetrate your front with little effort. Thus, it is advised to take cover, angle, or destroy them first. Shermans are not much threat since they won't really penetrate your armour, but sometimes they do. They are easy to deal with as your 57 mm gun can punch straight through. Your 57 oddly does a lot of damage for a 57 mm gun. It can one shot Panzer III's, and sometimes Shermans if you aim correctly. Overall, the Churchill III is a very powerful Rank III vehicle that is capable of holding off an entire flank, while destroying tanks easily in quick succession.\n\nIf you are not in an up-tiered situation, you can effectively enter a battle and absorb all the enemy rounds which could've been fired at your weaker teammates and either engage the enemy with your 57 mm cannon or let your teammates return fire. Companion vehicles such as the [[Pz.IV F2|Panzer IV F2]], \"[[8,8 cm Flak 37 Sfl.|Flakbus]]\" and other German vehicles possess superior firepower compared to the other country vehicles in rank III (Except for other special TD's, such as the American [[M10 GMC|M10]] and British [[Achilles]]) and can in most cases hold their own.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness.

On August 8th, the Churchill Mk IV made its debut, as almost 60 of them had been allocated to assist the 6,000 British and Canadian troops raiding the beach. Of those, only the first 30 were deployed, and of those 30, one became trapped in its damaged landing craft, another two sank, and 11 were disabled by indirect fire and rough terrain. Despite the losses, this was the first successful use of heavy tanks in amphibious landings. In the chaotic evacuation that followed, the tanks that had deployed and survived the raid were unable to be recovered by the British and were abandoned. They, along with many other examples of British equipment, were captured by the Germans.\n\nThese tanks were later evaluated by the Germans. Though none were damaged by direct anti-tank fire, the Germans had come to the conclusion that the tanks were virtually obsolete, too underpowered and lacking proper firepower. Two of the twenty-nine tanks captured at Dieppe were used as ''Beutepanzers'' and saw service with the German military, repainted into the German standard grey colouration and marked with prominent Iron Crosses on the sides of the turret. The rest of the captured Churchills were repurposed for secondary combat roles, destroyed, or taken apart, with their turrets being used as improvised beach defences at Dieppe after the raid.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=germ_infanterie_kampfpanzer_churchill Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|0LHf6Jlb8yg|'''Infanterie Pz.Kpfw.
