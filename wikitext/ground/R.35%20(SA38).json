In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' (also known as the '''{{Specs|pseudonym}}''') is a rank {{Specs|rank}} French light tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.75 \"La Résistance\"]] as the R.39 and was subsequently renamed R.35 (SA38) in [[Update 1.89 \"Imperial Navy\"]].\n\nAlthough it is a light tank, the R.35 feels pretty cumbersome in every way: poor mobility, slow traverse speed and long reload time. It actually feels more like an heavy tank without the benefits of heavy armour. This tank's design is very similar to other French rank I light tanks. Hence, players should already be used to their shortcomings.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->\nWith good armour thickness and surprising hull angles, this tank can take some beating at a distance, provided you do not get a lucky shot in the turret ring or that you face a heavy-hitting gun. This should get you into effective combat ranges (500 - m) in relative safety. The most obvious weakspot is its turret flat left side, which is only 45 mm thick and badly angled, this makes hull-down position ineffective.\n\nWith its heavy side armour, one should use angles at its advantages and angle it at about 35° while facing opponents. Such an angling gives about 60 mm of effective thickness for 80% of the exposed area.\n\nIn an ambush position, this tank could face its opponents backwards (engine deck first). This unusual tactic could confuse enemies for a moment and provide extra protection as your engine may absorb shots. This will also decrease the chances of a lucky penetration : if turret is facing enemy, almost 90% of exposed surfaces have ~60 + mm of LoS thickness. If danger gets too high, you could give it the gas and \"fly\" away in forward motion.\n\n'''Armour type:'''\n\n* Cast homogeneous armour (hull, turret, cupola)\n* Rolled homogeneous armour (front glacis, engine vents)\n* Structural steel (mudguards, trench-crossing tail, storage boxes, exhaust cover)\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->\n\n{{tankMobility|abMinHp=89|rbMinHp=73}}\n\nThe mobility is the {{PAGENAME}}'s biggest weakness: while it does not like long-range engagements and needs to close-up with its foes in order to damage them, its very low speed will always leave it far behind its allies. With its narrow tracks and poor power ratio (8.09 HP/ton), the {{PAGENAME}} hates being taken out in the mud as its speeds fall drastically. 20 km/h forward and -3 km/h backwards is all you'll get from this struggling 73 HP engine. Plan your moves in advance and do not stay too near to the front line as a successful retreat is hard to achieve with such a slow tank.\n\n=== Modifications and economy ===\n{{Specs-Economy}}\n\n== Armaments ==\n{{Specs-Tank-Armaments}}\n=== Main armament ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Weapon|1}}\n<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun.

Avoid exchanging shots at long distances as your gun's penetration values decrease heavily beyond 500 m.

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\n'''Gameplay summary:'''\n\nThe R.35 is a decent light tank for its battle rating, so long as it is played with the right tactics. The most important aspect of R.35 gameplay is armour angling. Being that the side armour is actually thicker than the front armour, angling at 45 degrees or more is ideal. The tank is not particularly quick, so flanking is generally difficult, so sticking with your team is the best strategy. Generally, medium range engagements are ideal.\n\n'''Close Range Engagements:'''\n\nThe R.35 is capable at close range, although the slow reload can cause issues. The armour if angled correctly may bounce enemy rounds even at point blank range, however the R.35 must disable the enemy tank with the first shot. Most enemies that the R.35 will face have a faster reload, and may be able to outmanoeuvre it, as the R.35 is somewhat slow. This means that getting too close to the enemy is a mistake, always maintain some distance with quick enemies.\n\n'''Long Range Engagements:'''\n\nThe R.35 will struggle to deal damage at long range, the cannon having mediocre penetration and reload. However staying at range can also be a good strategy, as enemies may struggle to penetrate the armour of the R.35 as well.\n\n'''Notable Enemies:'''\n\nSome notable enemies include: any German vehicles that use 20 mm autocannons, these include [[Pz.II (Disambiguation)|Panzer II]] and [[Flakpanzer I|Flankpanzer]] tanks. Their autocannons will easily destroy the R.35 if the armour is not angled. Additionally, the R.35 struggles to penetrate Panzer II tanks.\n\nAdditionally, the R.35 will be easily penetrated by enemy vehicles equipped with the American [[M3 (37 mm)|37 mm M3]] cannon, the British [[QF 2-pounder (40 mm)|QF 2-pounder]] gun, or the Swedish [[Kan m/38 (37 mm)|37 mm kan m/38]] gun.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as \"bad\", \"good\" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as \"inadequate\" and \"effective\".'' -->\n\n'''Pros:'''\n\n* Gun with a good penetration power\n* Has decent sloped hull armour\n* Has a very thick gun mantlet area\n* Thick sides allows for heavy angling\n\n'''Cons:'''\n\n* Thin turret ring.\n* Limited crew count: 2 members (easy to immobilize with a single shot)\n* Extremely low speed, with bad cross-country and hill-climbing ability\n* Awful reverse speed of -3 km/h\n* Single type of ammunition, with no explosive filler\n* Slow reload speed\n\n== History ==\n<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction.

However, like its competitor H.35, its gun was known to be unsatisfactory as an anti-tank weapon.\n\nOnly a few of these R.35s could be converted to the improved SA 38 main gun prior to the fall of France, with the H.35s and H.39s of the cavalry receiving priority. It is known the 1st (Free) Polish Tank Regiment in France near Paris did receive some converted R.35s in May, 1940. These upgunned R.35 tanks are sometimes referred to (erroneously) as the R.39.\n\nConcurrently, in 1939, AMX had developed a new type of track and suspension for the R.35, which had continued to be produced. This new variant, also armed with the SA 38, and sometimes designated the R.40, had gone into production in March, 1940. It saw limited service, but it is known the 40th and 48th tank battalions had received 30 each, and the 1st Polish as many as another 25, in time to serve in the invasion and fall of France. Some of these were still around to be seized by French Resistance forces during the fall of Paris in 1944.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=fr_renault_r39 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|GCdwnUEASg8|'''Char léger d'accompagnement 1939 R, French, Tier-1, Light Tank''' - ''Angry Nerd Gaming''|FmxjzRZ2B_M|'''R.39 Tank Review''' - ''NUSensei''}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n;Other vehicles of similar configuration and role\n* [[H.39]]\n* [[H.39 \"Cambronne\"]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wikipedia:Renault_R35|[Wikipedia] Renault R35]]\n* [https://tanks-encyclopedia.com/ww2/france/Renault_R-35.php <nowiki>[Tanks Encyclopedia]</nowiki> Renault R35/40]\n\n{{France light tanks}}"}}
