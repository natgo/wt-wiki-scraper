In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Italian light tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.85 \"Supersonic\"]].\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->\n\n'''Armour type:'''\n\n* Aluminum alloy 7039 (hull)\n* Armored Glass (windows)\n* Wheel (tires)\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

This means that it will have the same level of protection. Compared to the FIAT Chassis (FIAT 6614 / AUBL/74), the armour is a lot better. This is because the front plate is 33 mm thick, which allows it to take a few hits from .50 cals, especially if angled. However, this tank is still vulnerable to heavy machine gun fire especially from strafing aircraft. Bombs and rockets also deal heavy damage if the {{PAGENAME}} is standing in their destruction radius.\n\nHowever, some good points in regards to the survivability is the ability to poke just the gun out of cover. This not only makes the tank very difficult to spot, but in case of a hit, only the barrel will be damaged (and often only 1 of them which allows you to fire with the other one).\n\n=== Mobility ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}\n<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->\n\n{{tankMobility|abMinHp= 147|rbMinHp= 84}}\n\nThe mobility of the {{PAGENAME}} is exactly the same as the [[R3 T20 FA-HS]]. Due to War Thunder's map sizes, the maximum speed that can be achieved before a turn has to be made is about 98 km/h. On regular terrain, speed will average about 60 km/h and 50 km/h when going up hills. This makes the {{PAGENAME}} one of the fastest armoured vehicles in the BR range. On desert maps, this tank fares much better compared to the FIAT chassis and the succeeding counterpart Centauro. It is capable of going about 30-35 km/h on desert terrain and a tad slower on snow terrain. It is faster than the FIAT chassis on all terrains and faster than famous fast light tanks like the Ru 251 on hard and medium terrain.\n\nThis excellent mobility allows you to flank very fast or go to a position even enemy fast tanks (such as the Super Hellcat) don't expect you to get to.\n\n=== Modifications and economy ===\n{{Specs-Economy}}\n\n== Armaments ==\n{{Specs-Tank-Armaments}}\n=== Main armament ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Weapon|1}}\n<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun.

The gun has quite a low velocity (500 m/s), making aiming above 600 m quite difficult as your range estimation has to be very accurate. However, the presence of another gun allows you to adjust your second shot, making it quite easy to hit moving targets up to 1000 m with your first shot. Above all that, even having a second gun has no guarantee of a hit, unless they are sitting still and not moving. The gun reloads with about 10 seconds, allowing for about 12 shots a minute (2 guns). Unfortunately, the {{PAGENAME}} has only 5 rounds per gun, so it is essential that the player does not waste the ammo on engagements over 1000 m to save ammo. Instead, use the excellent mobility to flank and get closer. The gun bounces more than most tankers are used to when coming to a stop, which leads to a very long time before it is ready to be fired. This can be counteracted by its second gun as the player may miss once but still have a second shot, reducing the \"fear factor\" of missing when timing gun bounce. The gun rotation speed is 20°/sec which is very good in reacting to new threats which appear.\n\n==== Ammunition ====\nThe {{PAGENAME}} gets access to both a HEAT round (400 mm penetration) and an all-out devastating HESH round (152 mm normal penetration). The HESH round often destroys enemies in one hit if used properly.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"100%\"\n! colspan=\"8\" | Penetration statistics\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" data-sort-type=\"text\" | Ammunition\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Type of<br>warhead\n! colspan=\"6\" | Penetration @ 0° Angle of Attack (mm)\n|-\n! 10 m !! 100 m !! 500 m !! 1,000 m !! 1,500 m !! 2,000 m\n|-\n| M344A1 || HEAT || 433 || 433 || 433 || 433 || 433 || 433\n|-\n| M361A1 || HESH || 152 || 152 || 152 || 152 || 152 || 152\n|-\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"100%\"\n! colspan=\"10\" | Shell details\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" data-sort-type=\"text\" | Ammunition\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Type of<br>warhead\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Velocity<br>(m/s)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Projectile<br>Mass (kg)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Fuse delay<br>(m)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Fuse sensitivity<br>(mm)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Explosive Mass<br>(TNT equivalent) (g)\n! colspan=\"3\" | Ricochet\n|-\n! 0% !! 50% !! 100%\n|-\n| M344A1 || HEAT || 502 || 10 || 0 || 0.01 || 1,650 || 65° || 72° || 77°\n|-\n| M361A1 || HESH || 498 || 10 || 0.1 || 4 || 5,040 || 73° || 77° || 80°\n|-\n|}\n\n==== [[Ammo racks]] ====\n[[File:Ammoracks_{{PAGENAME}}.png|right|thumb|x250px|[[Ammo racks]] of the {{PAGENAME}}]]\n<!-- '''Last updated: 1.101.1.16''' -->\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!

Refrain from creating a \"guide\" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\nSimilar to most other light tanks, the best way to play this vehicle is either as an ambush vehicle or as a flanking vehicle. This helps to avoid direct confrontations which in turn masks the vehicle's greatest weaknesses which are poor fire stability (gun bounce) and poor armour. This also capitalises on its main advantage which is its insane speed. Ambushing even in highly popular pathways can be very successful with this tank due to its presence of 2 guns, reducing the chance you will be overwhelmed. Brawling can be done in this vehicle due to its fast acceleration, allowing it to duck in and out of cover to fire very quickly.\n\nAs mentioned in the armament section, using the right round can lead to great success against opponents. Knowing how to use the HESH round is imperative to success with this vehicle. Due to the nature of HESH, some tanks will require a more precise targeting for effective use, so here are some recommendations for success with HESH:\n\n* Conqueror - Lower front plate, rear half of turret (front half is a non-penn), cupola\n* T34/T29 - Turret roof, turret ring, turret side, anywhere on hull\n* M103 - Anywhere on the hull, turret side. Do not target the gun mantlet and other relatively unangled areas\n* Caernarvon - Anywhere on turret except the gun mantlet (and even the sloped parts since 100% ricochet is at 80°)\n* T32 - Anywhere on the hull, turret side\n* T95 - Roof, upper front plate, sides, cupola\n* IS-6 - Turret sides, anywhere on the hull\n* IS-3- Anywhere on hull, upper half of side turret (lower half has 156mm armour, which is more than 152mm penn), Turret ring\n* T-54 - Turret side, upper front plate\n* IS-4M - the toughest for the {{PAGENAME}}. The upper front plate is easily penetrated, but the angled plate and the hull sides as well as turret sides are all too tough. Even the rear is too tough except for the top half of the rear turret armour. Basically shoot the upper front plate, but anywhere else will be bounce or protected by tracks.\n\nFrom the list, the recommended shot on most tanks with HESH is the turret side armour, as there is no tracks or side skirts to block your shell and armour there even on heavy tanks is usually less than 152 mm raw thickness.\n\nBe careful when shooting an angled upper front plate of tanks, as since it is angled the HESH will send a blast downwards, which might only knock out the machine gunner and driver. However, if you aim towards the top half of the upper front plate, the shrapnel is powerful enough that it should incapacitate all of the turret crew anyways. Also, don't shoot the engines unless you have to, as a potent shot is rare and you won't one shot with a solid hit. The two guns the {{PAGENAME}} can allow for one shot to go for the cannon barrel or tracks first, then the second gun can lineup for a good shot on a weak spot.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as \"bad\", \"good\" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as \"inadequate\" and \"effective\".'' -->\n\n'''Pros:'''\n\n* Powerful 106mm recoilless rifles\n* Insane top speed; can give the M18 Hellcat a run for its money\n* Resilient to machine gun fire from the front\n* Can swim\n\n'''Cons:'''\n\n* Will be prioritized as a target by the enemy team due to its notoriety\n* Flips over very often\n* Thin armor\n* Can be destroyed simply by ramming it at top speed\n* Even LMG fire can destroy the engine from the rear\n* Takes time to aim gun due to the wobbly suspension, especially when stock\n\n== History ==\n<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction.

Investing heavily into research and development efforts, OTO Melara continued developing the design into a \"Special Task Vehicle\" as part of a private venture.\n\nThe resulting OTO R3, nicknamed in production as \"Capraia\" was first shown off at the Italian Naval Exhibition in Genoa in 1982. The new vehicle received increased armor protection around its body, protecting the crew from rifle caliber fire and shrapnel. Furthermore, the vehicle could be armed with various weaponry, ranging from MGs, over cannons to ATGMs, depending on the version.\n\nDespite their very promising and versatile design, this family of combat vehicles were only built and used in very limited numbers.\n\n''- From [[wt:en/news/5977-development-oto-r3-t106-double-barrel-mayhem-en|Devblog]]''\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicleCountry=italy&vehicleType=tank&vehicleClass=light_tank&vehicle=it_oto_r3_106sr Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|RGeu2yLGeTU|'''Best armored cars''' discusses the {{PAGENAME}} at 2:14 - ''War Thunder Official Channel''|MOc30cp2osY|'''When one of the fastest tanks has firepower advantage too - {{PAGENAME}}''' - ''HowToPlay1337''|7H5iB4U4xic|'''The Shooting Range #138''' - ''Metal Beasts'' section at 00:35 discusses the {{PAGENAME}}.|THectIp7tzg|'''Hit and Run - {{PAGENAME}} Italian Meme Machine''' - ''Virus''}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n;Vehicles equipped with the same chassis\n\n* [[R3 T20 FA-HS]]\n\n;Other vehicles of similar configuration and role\n\n* [[M50 Ontos]]\n* [[T114]]\n* [[Type 60 SPRG (C)]]\n* [[FIAT 6614]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wt:en/news/5977-development-oto-r3-t106-double-barrel-mayhem-en|[Devblog<nowiki>]</nowiki> OTO R3 T106: Double Barrel Mayhem]]\n* [https://en.topwar.ru/41170-broneavtomobili-oto-melara-gorgona.html <nowiki>[Topwar.ru]</nowiki> OTO Melara Gorgona R2.5 and R3 Capraia armored cars]\n\n{{Italy light tanks}}\n[[Category:Wheeled ground vehicles]]"}}
