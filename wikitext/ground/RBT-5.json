In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium gift rank {{Specs|rank}} Soviet light tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was available as a prize during the [[wt:en/news/3480--en|2015 Thunder League]] as a giveaway prize for watching the Twitch stream, later every Dog-Tag owner who voted for Team Dislike earned one due to the \"Champion\" prize. It can now only be obtained via the [[War Thunder Market]].\n\nThe RBT-5 is a regular [[BT-5]] with mounts on the side of the turret to hold two 250 kg TT-250 \"tank torpedo\" rockets. These large calibre rockets are hard to aim as they're angled upwards but can destroy almost anything it hits.\n\nThis tank is quite unique. It has virtually no armour, weights only 11,5 tons and has a massive 400 HP engine (442 HP fully upgraded), giving it up to a 38 HP/Ton ratio. This paired with excellent Christie suspension allows it to drive like a race car among tanks. Gun is an adequate 45 mm 20-K cannon with decent penetration and quick reload.\n\nDo remember: the RBT-5's two rockets are quite apart from each other, and that should be taken into account when aiming. The first rocket to be fired is the one on the left side of the turret.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection.

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\nThe RBT-5 is really flexible when it comes to usage, as it has great mobility and firepower, which is pretty much all you need for a good tank. Given its great 53 km/h top speed, it is good to use the RBT-5 as a point-capping tank at the start of the match. It is better to travel on-road to fully utilise its speed to get to the point before the enemies do. Another good tactic is to manoeuvre to the flank of the frontline/point and attack from the side. Its speed makes it possible to go the furthest with the shortest time, surprising the enemies.\n\nOnce capped, the player can either quickly ambush behind a nearby cover waiting for the enemy to re-cap it, or just drive around the battlefield and help the teammates. Its 70 mm penetration and 29 g TNT will knock out pretty much anything around its BR with a single shot. If not, the 3 seconds reload allows it to finish them off easily. A sudden, close encounter is a hard test to the player's skills because the RBT-5 isn't very good at turning as its tracks are quite long and narrow. Its turret traverse of around 11 deg/sec is certainly not the best. Thus those two factors can sometimes cause the death of the RBT-5 so the player must respond fast and accurate.\n\n'''Enemies worth noting:'''\n\n* [[Pz.II (Disambiguation)|Pz.IIs]]: Although not as fast as the RBT-5, the Pz.IIs still have an average speed of around 40km/h. Also, they are equipped with a deadly 20 mm autocannon that will punch holes on the RBT-5 with ease, and their rate of fire can quickly kill multiple crew. The RBT-5 has thin armour protecting only 3 crew, making it extremely vulnerable to those autocannons.\n\n* [[Sd.Kfz.234/2|Sd.Kfz.234 series]]: These wheeled vehicles all have scary on-road speeds of more than 60 km/h, so in any map, with roads connecting to the points they can always get there first and set up an ambush. However, these vehicles are wheeled meaning they cannot turn in place, they are rather sluggish when trying to turn, and they have either slow turret traverse or no turret at all so the player can use this to their advantage. Wiggle/circle around them to avoid their guns and force them to turn, then aim carefully and immobile them. Note that the DT machine gun on the RBT-5 only has 10 mm penetration at most, making it almost impossible to go through their armour and kill any crew, so don't think of destroying these wheeled tanks with the MG.\n\n* [[M8 Greyhound]], [[M3 Stuart (Family)|M3 Stuarts]]: These vehicles are equally fast, and the M8 can outrun the RBT-5 if it's travelling on road, allowing them to get to the point before the RBT-5 does. Therefore if America is on the other side the player might want to change their tactic and not to rush the point since low tier battles are always filled with fast tanks. The M8 has a roof-mounted .50 cal MG which easily tears the RBT-5's armour apart and kills the crew inside. Also, most of them have a vertical stabiliser that works at low speed, so avoid firing on the move with them.\n\n* [[B1 bis]]: A heavily armoured tank for its BR, but do not panic when you see it. Don't fire at a distance unless you are directly aiming at its side armour. The best option is to try and get as close to it as possible (point-blank range is ideal) and shoot straight at its side. However sometimes due to a variety of reasons the player might be unable to flank it and has to face it frontally. If that is the case, shoot the rather vertical driver's compartment and there's a great chance of penetration, killing the driver and the commander (which is also the gunner for the turret). Or, shoot between the two guns on the turret to kill the commander/gunner. Or, shoot at the near-vertical part of the curved gun mantlet of the big gun.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness.
