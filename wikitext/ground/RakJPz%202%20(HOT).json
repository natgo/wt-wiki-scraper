In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} German tank destroyer {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.63 \"Desert Hunters\"]]. Compared to its [[RakJPz 2|predecessor]], this variant has an upgraded missile known as the '''HOT''' ('''H'''igh Subsonic '''O'''ptical Remote-Guided, '''T'''ube-Launched) that is aimed by simply sticking the gun's sight onto the desired target.\n\nDue to its relatively low profile, the Raketenjagdpanzer 2 HOT is able to completely conceal itself behind hills and rocks and fire over them. This allows for quick hit and run strikes, and ambushes are made much easier. According to several commanders, the reverse rate of this vehicle is outstanding, allowing retreat if needed. The ATGM itself is rather glitchy in long-range flight but is outstanding in mid to close range engagements. However, it cannot fire directly in front of it, nor does the ATGM perform well in vertical manoeuvring.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection.

The result came in 1961 with the ''Raketenjagdpanzer 1'', which features the French SS.11 anti-tank missile. The Raketenjagdpanzer 1 features two mounts for the missiles, but only one is available at a time as while one remains ready to fire, the other is reloading inside the vehicle. The vehicle can hold 10 missiles inside on a Hispano-Suiza HS-30 chassis. The vehicle carried lots of problems with the HS-30 chassis so only a limited amount was made at only 95 vehicles produced from 1961 to 1962. A second version was produced alongside the [[JPz 4-5|Jagdpanzer 4-5]] between 1963 and 1965, and the two were designed on the same chassis. The finished model was designated the ''[[RakJPz 2|Raketenjagdpanzer 2]]'' and this was accepted into service in 1967 for the German Bundeswehr. The Raketenjagdpanzer 2 was produced from 1967 to 1968 with a total of 318 units produced.\n\n===Design===\nThough slightly larger than the Raketenjagdpanzer 1, the Raketenjagdpanzer 2 had better automotive performances with a newer chassis and using a 500 hp diesel engine and a torsion bar suspension. The new vehicle chassis design allowed for increased missile storage for 14 SS.11 missiles. The Raketenjagdpanzer 2 features two rails for the missiles, both ready to fire and reloads are done automatically by each mount inside the vehicle. The SS.11 missiles allow the vehicle to engage enemy armour up to 3 kilometres away, with the missiles strong enough to take out most Soviet armour at the time. MG3 machine guns were added onto the vehicle for anti-infantry and anti-aircraft defence purposes.\n\n===Usage===\nThe German Bundeswehr used the Raketenjagdpanzer 2 from 1967 as far as to the early 2000s. The Raketenjagdpanzer 2's purpose was to engage enemy armour in the ranges between 1.5 to 3 kilometres away, which tank armaments accuracy and power are reduced at the distances. The SS.11 missile's range and lethality made the Raketenjagdpanzer 2 perfect for its role as it could defeat the main Soviet tanks such as the [[T-54 (1951)|T-54/55]] and [[T-62]]. The Germans organized the Raketenjagdpanzer 2 in tank destroyer companies attached to Panzergrenadier brigades and Panzer brigades, with eight vehicles per company in the Panzergrenadier brigades and 13 vehicles per company in the Panzer brigades. When the manual-guided SS.11 missiles became obsolete, the Raketenjagdpanzer 2 underwent an upgrade between 1978 and 1982 in armour and in its missile armament from the SS.11 to the '''HOT''' ('''H'''igh Subsonic '''O'''ptical Remote-Guided, '''T'''ube-Launched) missiles with improved lethality and guidance system. The upgraded Raketenjagdpanzer 2 was called the '''[[RakJPz 2 (HOT)|Raketenjagdpanzer 2 HOT]]'''. This saw an improvement again between 1993 and 1995 when some extra armour, a new optic, and thermal imaging system were installed into the vehicle. This upgrade was called the Raketenjagdpanzer 3 Jaguar 1A3. The Raketenjagdpanzers were retired from the Bundeswehr in 2005 and the Austrian army in 2006, never seeing combat in the Cold War.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=germ_raketenjagdpanzer_2_hot Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|cv79zrNctuA|'''{{PAGENAME}}: Ready for the new E.R.A.?''' - ''Napalmratte''}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n* [[JPz 4-5]]\n* [[RakJPz 2]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wt:en/news/3737-development-raketenjagdpanzer-2-the-low-profile-slinger-en|[Devblog] Raketenjagdpanzer 2, the Low Profile Slinger]]\n\n{{Germany tank destroyers}}"}}
