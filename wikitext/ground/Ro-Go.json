Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium rank {{Specs|rank}} Japanese heavy tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.67 \"Assault\"]].\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->\n\nThe Ro-Go is an excellently protected vehicle for 1.3. Featuring armour thick enough to stop 12.7 mm machine-gun fire from all angles (except the roof), and even anti-tank guns if angled properly. The placement of modules deep down inside the hull, where most 1.3 players would never think of shooting, makes the chance that the ammo, engine, transmission and fuel tanks get hit rather low. Even the crew inside the tank are pretty well protected by the tank's armour, and if everything fails you still have the lone machine gunner in the back turret, which means that a lot of the time you will be able to make a partial recovery from getting shredded to pieces by the waves of Pz.IIs and M2A4s.\n\n'''Armour type:'''\n\n* Rolled homogeneous armour\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

It can take a beating due its relatively thick armour and with the crew placement it shouldn't be an easy task to simply knock it out with a single shell. The tricky part about the Ro-Go is the difference between shell velocities of the two cannons, the 70 mm has an abysmal muzzle velocity and quick drop off rate with 300 m/s on the ''Type 95 APHE'' and a mere 200 m/s on the ''Type 3 HEAT'' while the secondary cannon, a [[Type 94 (37 mm)|''37 mm Type 94'']], found on the [[Ha-Go|Type 95 Ha-Go]] has 575 m/s. As last armament to mention the Ro-Go has a MG turret in the back of the tank, which in-game won't really see much use and can be seen as a safe spot for the last crew member, but in-case a light armoured truck tries to flank the Ro-Go and no-one is covering the back, as last resort the MG could prove handy.\n\nAs noted in [[#Ammunition|ammunition]], the only real choice is the '''''Type 3 HEAT''''' round, as it has the highest filler and penetration force of all available rounds at the cost of muzzle velocity. Though this can be used in an advantage as enemies behind cover are never safe when an experienced Ro-Go tanker is around, and lobs shells over cover with ease.\n\nThe ''37 mm Type 94'' can be used to either be used to shoot beyond the regular range of the 70 mm, or bait out shots in close range so the enemies pop out of cover and make quick work of them with the main 70 mm cannon.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics.

The development of the Type 95 Ro-Go heavy tank is based on the older version of the tank, the Type 91 heavy tank, which featured only a single 57 mm gun and two turrets, which both armed with a 6.5 mm machine guns. The tank had a maximum armour plate thickness of 17 mm. Although the design was not successful and soon cancelled, this project became the stepping stone to the Type 95 Ro-Go tank.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=jp_type_95_heavy Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|RyA5KcS2hAw|'''Multi-turreted Tanks'''  discusses the {{PAGENAME}} at 2:04  - ''War Thunder Official Channel''}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n;Related Development\n\n* [[Ro-Go Exp.]]\n\n;Other vehicles of similar configuration and role\n\n* [[Nb.Fz.]]\n* [[Independent]]\n\n== External links ==\n''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.''\n\n{{Japan heavy tanks}}\n{{Japan premium ground vehicles}}"}}
