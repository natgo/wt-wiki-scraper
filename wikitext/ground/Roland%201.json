In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} French self-propelled anti-aircraft vehicle {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.89 \"Imperial Navy\"]].\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->\nThe armour of the Roland 1 is average compared to other SPAAGs of the same battle rating, such as the [[FlaRakPz 1]] or the [[FlaRakRad]], which still means that the user will have a hard time surviving an encounter against an MBT or other SPAAGs equipped with cannons with at least 30 mm of penetration, such as the [[SIDAM 25 (Mistral)|SIDAM 25]] if they are using an APDS belt. Because the Roland is the only top tier SPAAG currently available for France, it will be very common for the user to face against top-tier jets such as the [[MiG-21bis]] or the [[MiG-21MF (Germany)|MiG-21MF]]. These jets (and many more) have no problem shredding through the top of the tank with ease.\n\nAlmost every MBT in the game will have absolutely no problem destroying you with a single shot into the front of the tank, as the 30 mm thick front plate is inadequate for protection and the spall created from APFSDS shells will be more than enough to wipe out your crew. However due to the large interior of the tank and the spacing of the crew, one might survive an APFSDS shot to the side provided it does not hit the munitions, a fuel tank, or the driver and the commander at the same time. Due to the tank being larger, the modules such as the engine or the transmission won't be enough to stop a shot from the back. Because of this, one should avoid direct confrontation with a hostile MBT at any given time.\n\n'''Armour type:'''\n\n* Rolled homogeneous armour (Hull, turret)\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Refrain from creating a \"guide\" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\nAlways scan the clouds for enemy jets. Since you cannot engage hostile MBTs, there is no point trying to get into positions where MBTs may be lurking. Your best bet would be to stick to cover from where you can constantly scan the sky for enemy jets while also being safe from hostile MBTs. Due to your size, you won't be able to find cover all that easily, so if needed, you can stay behind a hill and wait until your team advances so that you can reposition and find new cover that is way more effective.\n\nYour missiles have no problem catching even the fastest of the jets, but speed is not everything. Try to strike down jets which are crippled or in the middle of a manoeuvre. There is no point in wasting a missile on a jet that has plenty of energy and time to react and dodge your missile. This plays a major factor in your performance because you can only carry 10 missiles and getting to a capture point to refill your missiles might not be an easy task to accomplish in some maps.\n\nIf you encounter helicopters, they are an easy target as long as you manage to spot them first. If they spot you first and you do not notice it, it is very likely your tank is gonna get hit by an AGM, which due to Roland's thin armour, results in an instant KO. If you are not sure if the hostile team has a helicopter, wait behind cover that protects you from the spawning helicopters and scout around or wait till your teammates call out the enemy helicopter. You should also bear in mind that the range of your missiles is roughly 6,300 m, which might not be enough against certain helicopters in some cases, such as the [[Ka-52]]/[[Ka-50|50]] or the [[EC-665 Tiger UHT]].\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness.

Designed in the late 1960s, the Roland 1 was accepted for service in the late 1970s and served with the French Army. An improved version, the [[FlaRakPz 1|Roland 2]], was accepted for service a short time later, with improved capability including all-weather operations. The Roland system has been widely exported to a variety of nations, and has been used during the Falklands Conflict and Iran-Iraq war.\n\n=== Design and development ===\nIn the late 1960s, the first surface-to-air missile systems began to emerge as potent anti-aircraft defence systems. As a result, in 1964, representatives of the French and German governments signed an agreement to jointly develop a new self-propelled anti-aircraft missile launcher system (SPAAML), named Roland. The work was conducted by Messerschmitt-Bolkow-Blohm (MBB) on the German side, and Aerospatiale-Matra on the French side. The first prototype for the system was rolled out in 1967, and in 1977, the French government accepted the first Roland 1 SAM system into service.\n\nThe French Roland 1 SPAAML was based off of the [[AMX-30]] Chassis. It was operated by 3 crew members, and was fitted with a large central turret carrying two Roland SAMs, along with the corresponding search radar. The Roland 1 was limited to clear-weather operations, and was semi-automatic, unlike the fully-automatic Roland 2 and Roland 3 systems. The Roland 1 missiles themselves had a maximum firing range of 6.5 kilometres, with a top speed of 900 m/s (Mach 2.5).\n\n=== Operational History ===\nThe Roland 1 first entered service with the French Army in 1977, with a total of 83 Roland 1 missile batteries being produced. These served as the primary French SPAA system, though they were quickly supplemented by more advanced Roland 2 and Roland 3 systems. The Roland missile system has now been removed from French service, being replaced by more advanced, modern missile systems such as the Mistral.\n\nThe Roland missile system was widely exported, serving with multiple nations including Argentina, Brazil, Qatar, Spain, Nigeria and Venezuela. As well, it was one of the few foreign missile systems used by the United States. Roland missiles were used during the Falklands conflict of 1982, and reportedly shot down four British Sea Harriers. However, there is conflicting data on this claim, which cannot be confirmed. Iraq also used the Roland system during the Iran-Iraq war, shooting down an [[F-4E Phantom II|F-4E]] Phantom and a F-5 Tiger. Most Roland SAM batteries have now been phased out, replaced by more modern weapons.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=fr_amx_30_roland Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|luvhoX8Ht1I|'''New anti-air defence'''  discusses the {{PAGENAME}} at 3:44  - ''War Thunder Official Channel''}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n;Vehicles equipped with the same missile\n\n* [[FlaRakPz 1]]\n* [[FlaRakRad]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wikipedia:AMX-30#Variants|[Wikipedia] AMX-30 - Variants]]\n* [https://www.tanks-encyclopedia.com/coldwar/France/AMX-30-Roland-SAM.php <nowiki>[Tanks Encyclopedia]</nowiki> AMX-30 Roland]\n\n=== References ===\n\n* Missilery Missile Database.
