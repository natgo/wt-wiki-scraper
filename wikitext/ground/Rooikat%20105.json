In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium gift rank {{Specs|rank}} British light tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.97 \"Viking Fury\"]].\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->\n\nThe armour thickness ranges from 15 mm on the sides of the lower front plate to 30 mm near the gun breech of rolled homogeneous armour. This will protect the crew from small arms fire only, most 20 mm guns and above can penetrate the armour with relative ease. Most HE and HESH shells will overpressure the vehicle.\n\nWheels and suspension arms are made from 10 mm of structural steel.\n\nThe internal modules are relatively far apart and create a rather big empty space in the center of the vehicle. This gives it a small chance to survive APDS shells from the side when the turret is turned 90 degrees to either side, when the turret is pointed forward or backward, it fills this space with the ready ammo rack. Ammunition is also stored in the upper sides of the hull, as well as the rear of the turret.\n\nThe driver sits alone in the front of the vehicle while the commander, gunner and loader are placed rather high in the vehicle. This gives the turret crew a decent chance to survive side hits to the hull. A hit on the lower plate's left side (viewed from the front) will most likely kill the gunner, commander and driver and therefore destroy the vehicle.\n\n'''Armour type:'''\n\n* Rolled homogeneous armour (hull, turret, cupola)\n* Wheel (tires, torsion bars)\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->\n\n{{tankMobility|abMinHp=879|rbMinHp=501}}\n\nMobility is extremely good. The engine will propel the vehicle to 130 km/h (AB) / 120 km/h (RB/SB) maximum on roads, though the average speed is around 40 to 65 km/h in light terrain, but acceleration is relatively poor. The wheeled chassis will allow to turn the vehicle without losing too much speed, though turning on the spot is not possible. When crossing deep snow or sand the driver sometimes can't decide which gear to use and the vehicle will be stuck at the speed of that specific gear change even if it potentially has the power to go faster. Performance on any sort of incline is pretty poor with low power making some normally accessible slopes impossible to climb, care should be taken so as to not get stuck at the bottom of a trough.\n\n=== Modifications and economy ===\n{{Specs-Economy}}\n\n== Armaments ==\n{{Specs-Tank-Armaments}}\n=== Main armament ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Weapon|1}}\n<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun.

Give advice on how to use them and how to fill the ammunition storage.'' -->\n{{main|GT-7 (105 mm)}}\n\nThe vehicle is armed with the South African GT-7 105 mm rifled cannon, which is almost identical to the L7A3 used on the German Leopard and Leopard A1A1. It gets the same ammunition choices of DM12 HEATFS, DM502 HESH, and DM23 APFSDS, in addition to the improved DM33 APFSDS shell, as well as the same reload speed.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"100%\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" | [[GT-7 (105 mm)|105 mm GT-7]] || colspan=\"5\" | Turret rotation speed (°/s) || colspan=\"4\" | Reloading rate (seconds)\n|-\n!

The HESH is very situational, but might be good for light-skinned vehicles or helicopters. It is usually best to mostly take APFSDS shells, since it can easily handle every vehicle type, but unlike HEATFS doesn't detonate on bushes or fences and isn't stopped by ERA.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"100%\"\n! colspan=\"8\" | Penetration statistics\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" data-sort-type=\"text\" | Ammunition\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Type of<br>warhead\n! colspan=\"6\" | Penetration @ 0° Angle of Attack (mm)\n|-\n! 10 m !! 100 m !! 500 m !! 1,000 m !! 1,500 m !! 2,000 m\n|-\n| DM12 || HEATFS || 400 || 400 || 400 || 400 || 400 || 400\n|-\n| DM502 || HESH || 127 || 127 || 127 || 127 || 127 || 127\n|-\n| DM23 || APFSDS || 337 || 335 || 330 || 322 || 314 || 306\n|-\n| DM33 || APFSDS || 408 || 405 || 398 || 389 || 379 || 370\n|-\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"100%\"\n! colspan=\"10\" | Shell details\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" data-sort-type=\"text\" | Ammunition\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Type of<br>warhead\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Velocity<br>(m/s)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Projectile<br>Mass (kg)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Fuse delay<br>(m)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Fuse sensitivity<br>(mm)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Explosive Mass<br>(TNT equivalent) (g)\n! colspan=\"3\" | Ricochet\n|-\n! 0% !! 50% !! 100%\n|-\n| DM12 || HEATFS || 1,173 || 10.5 || 0.05 || 0.1 || 1,270 || 65° || 72° || 77°\n|-\n| DM502 || HESH || 732 || 14.85 || 0.1 || 4 || 4,310 || 73° || 77° || 80°\n|-\n| DM23 || APFSDS || 1,455 || 3.79 || N/A || N/A || N/A || 78° || 80° || 81°\n|-\n| DM33 || APFSDS || 1,455 || 3.79 || N/A || N/A || N/A || 78° || 80° || 81°\n|-\n|}\n\n==== [[Ammo racks]] ====\n[[File:Ammoracks_{{PAGENAME}}.png|right|thumb|x250px|[[Ammo racks]] of the {{PAGENAME}}]]\n<!-- '''Last updated:''' -->\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!

It is as nimble and powerful as an African rock python. Both of these almighty animals have one major weakness - they both lack protection, which is the same for the Rooikat 105.\n\nA main advantage of the Rooikat 105 is its ability to capitalise on its speed,.It is able to find a concealed spot and wait for its prey to cross into its sights. The Rooikat 105 features an up-gunned cannon, from 76 mm to 105 mm, an increase of 38%. Which means it's a 38% larger round hitting the target. Its GT-7 105 mm rifled cannon is highly accurate, able to deliver its round on target over 3,000 metres away. Additionally, the Rooikat 105 features thermal sights, which makes finding enemy tanks that are using foliage a breeze.\n\nHowever, it lacks any armour, the thickest part of this fine tank is around the barrel at 40 mm. The front only offers up to, 30 mm. The side offers only up to 25 mm of thickness. This means that a .50 calibre rifle will be able to penetrate the tank.\n\n'''''Engaging enemy tanks'''''\n\nUnlike other tanks in the British tree which allow for a broadside to be taken, the Rooikat cannot, as it lacks any type of protection, the only protection it allows for is over-penetration of high fuse rounds. The technical advantages of this tank must be played to the fullest extent by leveraging the advantages of the terrain on the map. This means that hills, houses, bridges, forests and ridges are used along with the appropriate camouflage selection for the map, to reduce the chances of being seen by the enemy.\n\nWhen engaging enemy tanks, aim for the sides and front, ideally aim for the location of crew members and critical elements - anywhere which is flat.\n\n* The DM33 APFSDS shell offers up to 400 mm of penetration.\n\nThe Rooikat will allow for them to be seen, whether it be day or night, using the thermal gun sight. Make sure to use the laser rangefinder to adjust and correct the shot so it hits the enemy tank the first time. If the shot misses, move the tank to another location the reload takes up to 6.7 seconds. Most rival tanks provide an auto-loader which substantially reduces their reload times, they may be able to fire two or three rounds in this time towards your location. Only one round needs to hit to knock you out.\n\n'''''Night Battles'''''\n\nRooikat 105, is the African rock python, just like the snake itself at night this lightly armoured vehicle becomes the master of the battle. Its fast speed, high agility and accurate cannon allows for it to be unseen, in the dead of night. It's vital to use your thermal sights as well as using the vegetation to make sure enemy tanks such as the [[Object 120]] do not detect you. They can easily knock you out with one shot from their pin-point accurate dart like rounds, which can destroy the toughest of tanks easily.\n\nIt's extremely important that, when you have fired a shot, you move to a new location, using the darkness of battle as your cover. Do not stay in the same spot, because the enemy tanks will have seen your muzzle flash and now would be scanning the battlefield in that area with their thermal sights or radar. Instead, fire one shot, move and repeat and keep the enemy unaware of your presence.\n\n'''''Capturing & Defending Zones'''''\n\nUse the gunner's thermal sight to check the area of the cap zone making sure no light sources can be seen. If it is clear and no enemy tanks are hiding in the distance waiting for you to cross into their sights, head towards the cap. When approaching the cap zone head towards an object in the cap zone and stay behind it while you cap the zone.\n\nDefending the cap zone is a easy process, withdraw from the zone and use the terrain to your advantage. The enemy will try to counterattack, wait for them to counterattack, then only once they are close use the APFSDS rounds to knock them out.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as \"bad\", \"good\" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as \"inadequate\" and \"effective\".'' -->\n\n'''Pros:'''\n\n* Excellent mobility\n* Has early access to the DM33 APFSDS, which arguably makes it even more dangerous than medium tanks, especially considering its top speed\n* Decent gun handling, even on the move due to the two-plane gun stabilizer\n* Has access to thermal optics, unlike the [[Rooikat_Mk.1D]], allowing it to see throught its own ESS, among other benefits\n\n'''Cons:'''\n\n* Poor survivability against autocannons, reloads slower than many light tanks\n* Susceptible to the overpressure mechanic, it is possible to deny its rush attack by simply being prepared\n* Poor turn rate\n\n== History ==\n<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block \"/History\" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template.

This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->\nAn upgrade and redesign program for the Rooikat was launched by Reumech OMC in 1990 for use internationally. This led to the development of the Rooikat 105 prototype with the GT-7 105 mm rifled cannon. The Rooikat 105 was made for high mobility operations taking place in both day and night. It was equipped with night vision and thermal imagery equipment for operations taking place in the dark of night. The gun used in the Rooikat 105 is the GT-7 105 mm rifled anti-tank gun. It fires a range of {{Annotation|NATO|North Atlantic Treaty Organization}} tank shells including HEATFS, HESH and APFSDS. This gun can fire up to 6 rounds a minute (about 10 second reload). On the real version, there are two 7.62 mm machine guns for anti-infantry and anti-air, one in the turret and one in the commander's position. In-game there is only one in the turret. There are 4 smoke grenades on each side of the turret in a smoke screen configuration and the ability to use an exhaust generator. Automatic data input includes the laser rangefinder that can calculate the range of a target as well as the speed, direction of travel, wind speed, wind direction and weapon tilt. Manual data input only includes the ammunition type and the environment of its surroundings. The weapon system allows the Rooikat 105 to attack targets while on the move on rough terrain. The most complex systems of the Rooikat 105 are the gun stabiliser, the gunner's stabilised sight, the gunner's sight with night vision and the commander's individual panoramic sight.\n\n=== [[wt:en/news/6602-development-rooikat-105-the-cat-with-bigger-claws-en|Devblog]] ===\nAfter the Rooikat 76 entered production in the early 1990s, South African engineers continued developing the vehicle in an effort to further expand upon its capabilities. As such, the engineers decided to, among other minor changes and improvements, fit the Rooikat with a larger 105mm cannon, thus creating the Rooikat 105 in the process.\n\nDevelopment of the Rooikat 105 was completed in 1994 and a single prototype was built. However, after demonstrating the vehicle to the SANDF, the military decided not to procure the improved version of the Rooikat, given that they were already more than content with the base model of the vehicle.\n\nAs a result, the Rooikat 105 was subsequently offered on the export market in an effort to secure orders for the vehicles. However, despite its 105mm cannon and compatibility with most NATO rounds, the Rooikat 105 failed to attract the interest of any potential foreign customers. In the end, only a single prototype of the Rooikat 105 was constructed, with the vehicle never entering production due to lacking demand.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=uk_rooikat_105_td Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Images\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"150\">\nFile:Rooikat 105 WTWallpaper 01.jpg|\nFile:Rooikat 105 WTWallpaper 02.jpg|\nFile:Rooikat 105 WTWallpaper 03.jpg|\nFile:Rooikat 105 WTWallpaper 04.jpg|\nFile:Rooikat 105 WTWallpaper 05.jpg|\nFile:Rooikat 105 WTWallpaper 06.jpg|\n</gallery>\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|-5QiA_s4NTo|'''Premium Vehicles: Rooikat 105''' - ''War Thunder Wiki''}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n;Other vehicles of similar configuration and role\n* [[Radkampfwagen 90]]\n* [[Type 16]]\n* [[Centauro ROMOR]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wt:en/news/6602-development-rooikat-105-the-cat-with-bigger-claws-en|[Devblog] Rooikat 105: The Cat With Bigger Claws]]\n* [http://www.military-today.com/artillery/rooikat_105.htm <nowiki>[Military Today]</nowiki> Rooikat 105 Tank Destroyer]\n\n{{Britain light tanks}}\n{{Britain premium ground vehicles}}\n[[Category:Wheeled ground vehicles]]"}}
