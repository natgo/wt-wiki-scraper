In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' (SOMUA's 1935 S cavalry tank) is a rank {{Specs|rank}} French medium tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.75 \"La Résistance\"]]. As it was considered to be the best tank at its time, being very mobile, easy to maintain while having good combat characteristics. As WW2 struck, these were on the frontlines, hence the nickname [[wt:en/news/5175-development-somua-s-35-shield-of-the-republic-en|\"Shield of The Republic\"]]. This tank will surely feel like a breath of fresh air over its underpowered predecessors.\n\nThe S.35 has the same turret design as on the Char [[B1 bis]], meaning that the penetration, reload and turret rotation speed is the same (But there is no \"mail slot\" turret ring). The S.35 contains a 3 man crew (Gunner/Commander, Driver and Radio operator) so a well placed frontal shot from HEAT or from a high-calibre gun will in majority of cases destroy you on the spot. The S.35 is best used when showing only its strong turret, exposing only one crew member at a time brings extra survivability. The S.35 is a tall and cumbersome tank at its battle rating, though it is relatively mobile with a 40 km/h top speed.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat?

Still, do not completely rely on it as there are many foes that can easily penetrate it at any range. Take every bounced shot as a \"lucky roll\" and get back into cover as quick as possible as the next shot could be your last. Armour this thick makes this tank very resilient to SPAA shots from all sides. An effective way to angle this tank is by facing your enemy at 45°, showing them your right-hand track: this sides minimises shot traps (on the other side, a flat 40 mm plate is conveniently placed at the right angle to make this tactic as ineffective as possible). As for top armour, this tank is pretty much immune to strafing from anything ranging from rifle-calibre to HMG rounds, which are common aircraft armaments at this BR.\n\nIf you see a {{PAGENAME}}, aim at the connection of the lower/middle plate with the upper plate which meets at 90 degrees, despite being curved, creating a weak spot that often knocks them out if penetrated. If not then aim at the driver's optics to knock out both driver and  gunner. Flank if possible and make sure to be quite close to this tank's side as its armour is thick in this general area. The S.35 cannot fight more than one tank at a time, so if you can surround the {{PAGENAME}}, it will fall quickly due to poor reload rate and turret turning speed.\n\n=== Mobility ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}\n<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->\n\n{{tankMobility|abMinHp= 294|rbMinHp= 168}}\n\nForward motion of the {{PAGENAME}} is great, turning and reverse are awful. It has average crossing capability on soft terrain (snow, mud, etc.). Align your hull in a straight line towards your objective and hit the gas without correcting trajectory is the best way to maximise this tank's speed as any turning motion slows it down quite significantly.\n\n=== Modifications and economy ===\n{{Specs-Economy}}\n\n== Armaments ==\n{{Specs-Tank-Armaments}}\n=== Main armament ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Weapon|1}}\n<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun.

Its main flaw being slow reload and low spalling: make every shot count. Early commanders of French tanks should be used to command one-man turrets, with all their benefits and flaws. It is worth mentioning the shoulder gun stabilizer, which makes stop-and-shoot tactics effective.\n\n==== Ammunition ====\nThe {{PAGENAME}} has a limited choice of ammunition:\n\n* '''Mle1935''': APC; a solid shot with average penetration and no explosive filler.

Do not try to rush in ahead of the team or go solo, as 7/10 times you will be destroyed by a counter-flanking player. The S.35 is able to hold its ground if you create a corridor for people to come at you. If you are able to flank without being seen, just remember to check behind you every now and then.\n\nAll light tanks are to be feared as they can out-manoeuvre this cumbersome tank quite easily and most enemies with a bit of luck will eventually hit one of this tank's weak spots, the only thing to fear is facing a good bit of armour. With its low post-penetration damage, tank with many crew members are also hard to take down.\n\nIn a defensive role, it can be played in a hull down position on a hill. This lets you take full advantage of the gun's -18° of gun depression and means that only exceptionally well-placed shots will be able to harm you.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness.

SOMUA was the company assigned to the challenge, and by spring 1935 they completed construction of the first prototype, designated the AC3.\n\nUnfortunately, early testing revealed some flaws with the first prototype, which SOMUA subsequently fixed and released in a pre-production batch of four vehicles (called the AC4). This first batch demonstrated satisfactory performance. In 1936, the AC4 modification of the vehicle was adopted as the standard medium tank for the cavalry units of the French army. Shortly thereafter, it received the official designation of SOMUA S.35.\n\nProduction of the SOMUA S.35 began in 1936, with a goal of producing 600 vehicles. During production, however, financial restraints limited the number that could be produced. Of the initial 600 planned, only 450 were actually ordered and built for the French army.\n\nFollowing the outbreak of WW2, the S.35 was soon deployed to defend French soil against a German invasion. Because the tank was designed to fight contemporary armoured vehicles of other nations, it fared well against the onslaught of Panzer III's and early modifications of the Panzer IV.\n\nIn fact, in most battles where the S.35 clashed with German Panzers in engagement ranges of around 1,000 m, the S.35 was able to destroy the Panzers without taking any critical damage in return.\n\nUnfortunately, while the S.35 did reasonably well in combat, the mechanics servicing the vehicle had few kind words for it. Due to its cast hull and complex suspension design, the S.35 was notoriously difficult to service and maintain—so difficult that if the tank was damaged in combat, the crew was unlikely to be able to repair it on the battlefield.\n\nWhile the S.35 saw some success in battle, its victories were short-lived. In June 1940, France surrendered and German forces occupied the northern part of the country, while the Vichy government was established in the south. Dozens of S.35s were captured, modified, and then deployed by the German and Italian forces. A handful of S.35s were also given to axis allies such as Hungary and Bulgaria.\n\nThe S.35 was eventually decommissioned from active service at the end of hostilities in 1945.\n\n''- From [[wt:en/news/5175-development-somua-s-35-shield-of-the-republic-en|Devblog]]''\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=fr_somua_s35 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|4_cJ1CpEatw|'''Best gun depression'''  discusses the {{PAGENAME}} at 3:01 - ''War Thunder Official Channel''|vwE8wSgoDwY|'''SOMUA {{PAGENAME}}, French, Tier-1, Medium Tank''' - ''Angry Nerd Gaming''|HreZgJwCMzM|'''The Shooting Range #79''' - ''Pages of History'' section at 05:05 discusses the {{PAGENAME}}.|NBK3FOqZB4k|'''{{PAGENAME}} Tank Review''' - ''NUSensei''}}\n\n== See also ==\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wt:en/news/5175-development-somua-s-35-shield-of-the-republic-en|[Devblog] SOMUA S.35 - Shield of The Republic]]\n* [[wikipedia:SOMUA_S35|[Wikipedia] SOMUA S35]]\n* [https://tanks-encyclopedia.com/ww2/france/Somua_S35.php <nowiki>[Tanks Encyclopedia]</nowiki> SOMUA S35]\n\n{{France medium tanks}}"}}
