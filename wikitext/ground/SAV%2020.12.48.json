It was introduced in [[Update 1.95 \"Northern Wind\"]] as a [[wt:en/news/6510-development-sav-20-12-48-nordic-sledgehammer-en|premium pack]] in the Gaijin store. It was removed from sale after the [[wt:en/news/7674-shop-may-sale-en|2022 May sale]] and is currently unobtainable in-game.\n\nThe {{PAGENAME}} was a private venture by Bofors to design a next generation assault gun for both export purposes and indigenous use following WWII. The main goal was to make a light and manoeuvrable armoured vehicle with a 12 cm autocannon, capable of dealing with both soft targets and enemy tanks. A prototype was built during the late 1940s but no one was willing to buy it in a world that was littered in cheap surplus military vehicles and the project was scrapped.\n\nIn-game it is a very fast vehicle with a low silhouette and can easily manoeuvre around the map and flank enemies. It is armed with the aforementioned 12 cm autocannon of Bofors design and has a fire rate of 50 rounds per minute, meaning a reload speed of 1.2 seconds between shots, which is the highest in the game for its calibre. The gun's velocity however is subpar and requires good aim and close quarters combat to be effective. Another result of the low velocity is subpar penetration, but because of the vehicle's high mobility, coupled with the gun's high rate of fire and powerful ammunition, it has no trouble taking on any type of vehicle that it may come across during conventional matches.\n\n== General info ==\n[[File:Destroyed SAV 20.12.48.png|thumb|300px|A destroyed SAV 20.12.48]]\n\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->\n\nThe SAV 20.12.48 is very lightly armoured, sacrificing protection for mobility. The highly sloped glacis is 30 mm thick, and can sometimes cause rounds to ricochet, but it is not reliable in any sense of the word. The rest of the tank is vulnerable to even heavy machine guns, and the open top is extremely vulnerable to strafing aircraft. Ammunition is stored in two primary deposits at the back of the crew compartment and is easily hit if the vehicle is penetrated.\n\n'''Armour type:''' <!-- The types of armour present on the vehicle and their general locations -->\n<!-- Example: * Rolled homogeneous armour (Front, Side, Rear, Hull roof)\n* Cast homogeneous armour (Turret, Transmission area) -->\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->\n\n{{tankMobility|abMinHp=568|rbMinHp=354}}\n\nThe SAV 20.12.48 has excellent mobility for a tank destroyer, featuring a high top speed as well as a fast reverse. The result is a highly agile tank destroyer that is capable of taking positions or retreating into cover quickly.\n\n=== Modifications and economy ===\n{{Specs-Economy}}\n\n== Armaments ==\n{{Specs-Tank-Armaments}}\n[[File:SAV 20.12.48 top view.png|thumb|300px|Top view of the SAV 20.12.48]]\n\n=== Main armament ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Weapon|1}}\n<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun.

It is fitted with an automatic loader that is fed by a six-round clip, for a total of seven shots ready to go once fully loaded (including one in the gun barrel). The autoloader has an extremely fast reload of only 1.2 s, allowing the SAV 20.12.48 to engage up to seven targets in under 10 s. Once the clip has been expended, a new round must be loaded into the clip before the autoloader may be cycled and the gun made ready to fire. However, this process only takes a few seconds. The gun also has a good amount of gun depression, allowing the Sav 20.12.48 to abuse hills when combined with the high reverse speed.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"100%\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" | [[automatkanon (120 mm)|120 mm automatkanon]] || colspan=\"5\" | Turret rotation speed (°/s) || colspan=\"4\" | Reloading rate (seconds)\n|-\n!

With nearly 1 kg of explosive filler, it is extremely deadly and almost guaranteed to knock out anything with a single shot if it penetrates the crew compartment. Its penetration is quite respectable; although not quite enough to frontally penetrate everything the Sav 20.12.48 can encounter, it has more than enough penetration to kill most tanks from the side. It has a relatively low muzzle velocity, however, and is thus hard to hit with at long range.\n\nThe SAV 20.12.48 also has a capable HE shell;  '''sgr M/50Z''', with over 2 kg of explosive filler. This shell is capable of penetrating and overpressuring the roofs of most of the vehicles and is a great alternative if the APCBC doesn't cut it. It is especially effective at taking out hull-down opponents who attempt to hide their hull's weak spots.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"100%\"\n! colspan=\"8\" | Penetration statistics\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" data-sort-type=\"text\" | Ammunition\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Type of<br>warhead\n! colspan=\"6\" | Penetration @ 0° Angle of Attack (mm)\n|-\n! 10 m !! 100 m !! 500 m !! 1,000 m !! 1,500 m !! 2,000 m\n|-\n| hpgr M/50 || APCBC || 95 || 94 || 89 || 84 || 79 || 75\n|-\n| sgr M/50Z || HE || 28 || 28 || 28 || 28 || 28 || 28\n|-\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"100%\"\n! colspan=\"10\" | Shell details\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" data-sort-type=\"text\" | Ammunition\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Type of<br>warhead\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Velocity<br>(m/s)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Projectile<br>Mass (kg)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Fuse delay<br>(m)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Fuse sensitivity<br>(mm)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Explosive Mass<br>(TNT equivalent) (g)\n! colspan=\"3\" | Ricochet\n|-\n! 0% !! 50% !! 100%\n|-\n| hpgr M/50 || APCBC || 525 || 23.5 || 1.2 || 19 || 890 || 48° || 63° || 71°\n|-\n| sgr M/50Z || HE || 525 || 23.5 || 0 || 0.1 || 2,250 || 79° || 80° || 81°\n|-\n|}\n\n==== [[Ammo racks]] ====\n[[File:Ammoracks_{{PAGENAME}}.png|right|thumb|x250px|[[Ammo racks]] of the {{PAGENAME}}]]\n<!-- '''Last updated: 2.17.0.44''' -->\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!

It is fast enough to quickly setup ambush positions near where the enemy team is likely to pass by, and a careless team can quickly find itself losing up to seven tanks in less than 10 s to the Sav 20.12.48 lying in ambush. Ideally, the Sav 20.12.48 would also be in a hull down position, where most of the tank can be hidden since the gun is mounted near the top of the vehicle and the high reverse speed allows it to back into cover quickly.\n\nThe vehicle itself is very fragile, however, and if it is caught out of position it is very easily destroyed. It is also very vulnerable to aircraft due to the open top, and has no means of defending itself from aircraft.\n\nIt can also be very tempting to fire off all seven rounds at once, but as with all autoloaders, trigger discipline is a very important skill to develop in order to use the vehicle to its full potential.\n\nMost of the heavy tanks that the SAV 20.12.48 is able to face are largely resistant to your shells, especially if they're angled. If you see a KV-1 or Churchill, disengage and let your allies with better firepower take these out.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness.

The design was ready by the end of 1948 and a single prototype was constructed in the following year.\n\nHowever, while test results didn't seem to impress the Swedish military enough to consider placing an order for the vehicle, the factor that certainly sealed the vehicle's fate for good was its price. Namely, being developed with the use of its own funding, Bofors had to demand a high production price for the vehicle, a price deemed too high by the Swedish military considering the vehicle's most probable role being an infantry support vehicle.\n\nAs a result of the lacking interest, the SAV 20.12.48 never went into production. Despite its failure, the project wasn't a complete loss for Bofors, as some of the experiences gained during its development later found application in other vehicles, such as the far more successful Strv 103.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=sw_sav_fm48 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Images\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"150\">\nFile:SAV 20.12.48 WTWallpaper 01.jpg|\nFile:SAV 20.12.48 WTWallpaper 02.jpg|\nFile:SAV 20.12.48 WTWallpaper 03.jpg|\nFile:SAV 20.12.48 WTWallpaper 04.jpg|\nFile:SAV 20.12.48 WTWallpaper 05.jpg|\nFile:SAV 20.12.48 WTWallpaper 06.jpg|\n</gallery>\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|1Wx-xUnIqyI|'''The Shooting Range #182''' - ''Metal Beasts'' section at 00:32 discusses the {{PAGENAME}}.|xF4-TcnyWw0|'''Best tank destroyers''' discusses the {{PAGENAME}} at 5:17 - ''War Thunder Official Channel''|PosWOnOGkSo|'''Best experimental vehicles''' discusses the {{PAGENAME}} at 7:08 - ''War Thunder Official Channel''}}\n\n== See also ==\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wt:en/news/6510-development-sav-20-12-48-nordic-sledgehammer-en|[Devblog] SAV 20.12.48: Nordic Sledgehammer]]\n\n{{TankManufacturer AB Bofors}}\n{{Sweden tank destroyers}}\n{{Sweden premium ground vehicles}}"}}
