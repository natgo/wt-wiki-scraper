In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' (75 mm Self-Propelled Gun SAu 40) is a rank {{Specs|rank}} French tank destroyer {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.75 \"La Résistance\"]]. It distinguishes itself by its very tall cupola and thick gun barrel. This tank is equipped with APHE rounds, a rare feature in the French tech tree.\n\nAs it was developed from the French [[S.35]], this tank shares many of its characteristics such as the ~40 mm thick cast hull bolted onto the chassis, which is barely a widened version of its original. The track system is mostly the same as on the [[S.35]], with 25 mm plates covering the roller wheels. As for the hull, it's a widened variant of the [[S.35]]'s hull with two 8 mm grilles over the engine compartment and doors on the side.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->\nAs this tank is based off the [[S.35]], it shares many of its attributes when it comes to armour. A slight angle can defeat most shots this tank will take at this BR, this is useful to know when getting into position: from a distance and not showing neither side nor front to the enemy, you should be safe. As for frontal armour, its 40 mm overall thickness is not strong enough to withstand anything bigger than AA fire. But, a thing to consider with this weird pattern is its \"bouncy\" behaviour, principally around the gun mantlet: complex angles may just bounce some shots, making them loose some energy before hitting the main armour, this feature is peculiarly distinctive at gun's height.\n\nThe main weakness of this tank is its very tall MG turret, which makes it quite easy to spot and destroy, as it is thinner than the main armour. Any APHE penetrating this area will knock out the tank's commander, thus disabling its only MG and some shrapnels may even damage or incapacitate the driver, disabling this tank for good. A way to avoid getting spotted too easily is buying camouflage for the front cupola area, making it look more like a bush popping out a hill than a tank's turret. Try to hide the tank's lower hull part as it is only 34 mm thick.\n\n'''Armour type:'''\n\n* Cast homogeneous armour (hull, turret)\n* Rolled homogeneous armour (side skirts, engine vents, exhaust pipes)\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->\n\n{{tankMobility|abMinHp=270|rbMinHp=168}}\n\nWhile being mounted on a widened [[S.35]] hull, the heavier {{PAGENAME}} has the same engine as its predecessor, making it quite slow and unwieldy, with a very low power-to-weight ratio. In order to fulfill the task of getting into position, one should choose their route wisely and avoid risky spots as this SPG's terrible reverse speed makes it quite bad at hasty retreats. Mobility with the {{PAGENAME}} is an issue. It is arguably what makes this tank hard to master as it does not allow for good map placement. One positive of this tank's mobility, however, is that it has a decent hull traverse because of the ability to use both tracks when turning in place.\n\n=== Modifications and economy ===\n{{Specs-Economy}}\n\n== Armaments ==\n{{Specs-Tank-Armaments}}\n=== Main armament ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Weapon|1}}\n<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun.

However, the cannon has an average penetration power for its BR. And the APHE round fails to explode when targeting enemies' sides, as the round has a rather high fuze sensitivity. Another concern is its slow horizontal traverse, which makes it hard to react to fast-paced combat situations. The gun placement makes this tank quite vulnerable: being low, it exposes the SAu 40 to enemy fire when popping up a hill.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"100%\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" | [[APX (75 mm)|75 mm APX]] || colspan=\"5\" | Turret rotation speed (°/s) || colspan=\"4\" | Reloading rate (seconds)\n|-\n!

It still can be used to ping targets as a rangefinding help or to mow down minor obstacles blocking your line of sight.

As this is its purposed role, this tank has some issues accomplishing it. The first being its relatively low penetration and shell velocity, which makes long range engagements (>750 m)a bit hard to manage. The second being bad mobility, which complicates the task of positioning.\n\nAct as a classical SPG while keeping in mind your slow pace. There is nothing very much interesting nor special you can do with this tank.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness.

The vehicle inherited the S35's characteristic chassis with a redesigned front section of the hull to accommodate the 75 mm APX cannon. In addition, the rotating turret on top of the fighting compartment was redesigned to a commander's cupola and moved to the side of the vehicle, but the turret's 47 mm cannon was replaced with a single 7.5 mm machine gun.\n\nThe body of the SAu 40 was ready by 1937, but it couldn't be immediately completed. Because the cannon was not yet ready to be installed on the chassis, SOMUA engineers had to wait nearly 2 years before the cannon was finally made available. It wasn't until 1939 that the fully assembled prototype was completed, and orders for mass production were received in October of the same year.\n\nWhether or not any additional vehicles other than the prototype were built or if the vehicle took part in active fighting is unknown.\n\n''-From [[wt:en/news/5169-development-sau-40-the-ugly-duckling-en|Devblog]]''\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=fr_somua_sau40 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|gch68D19_C4|'''{{PAGENAME}}, French, Tier-2, Tank Destroyer''' - ''Angry Nerd Gaming''|9anvMISri-8|'''{{PAGENAME}} Tank Review''' - ''NUSensei''|uhgodizubC4|'''The Shooting Range #77''' - ''Pages of History'' section at 00:31 discusses the {{PAGENAME}}.}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n;Vehicles equipped with a similiar chassis\n\n* [[S.35]]\n\n;Other vehicles of similar configuration and role\n\n* [[Sav m/43 (1944)]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wt:en/news/5169-development-sau-40-the-ugly-duckling-en|[Devblog] SAu 40 - The Ugly Duckling]]\n* [[wikipedia:SOMUA_S35#Projects|[Wikipedia] SOMUA S35 - Projects]]\n\n{{France tank destroyers}}"}}
