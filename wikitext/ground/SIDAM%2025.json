Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' (shortened to '''{{Specs|pseudonym}}''') is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Italian self-propelled anti-aircraft gun {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.85 \"Supersonic\"]].\n\nThe SIDAM 25 is an optronics-aimed SPAA equipped with 4 x 25 mm Oerlikon KBA cannons with the ability to fire HEI-T* and APDS rounds. Because of the high fire density, this SPAA is able to destroy planes within seconds and just needing a few rounds to hit their target. The M792 belt rounds (HEI-T*) contain a TNT equivalent of 54.4 grams in each projectile, and have a high muzzle velocity of 1,100 m/s, making target leading much easier. However, because of the lack of armour-penetrating rounds in the standard belts, your maximum penetration remains 3 mm until you get the M791 belt (APDS). Once the M791 belt is unlocked, defeating tanks will be much easier, given the 81 mm of penetration at 10 metres, and a muzzle velocity of 1,345 m/s. The potential is however severely limited by the maximum capacity of 660 rounds (165 per gun). Overall, be very careful with your ammunition considering the fire rate and the small ammunition capacity. 4 x 550 rpm and a maximum of 660 rounds means you have about 18 seconds of continuous fire available.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection.

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\n\nThe SIDAM 25 can be quite deadly when used right, players who have unlocked this machine will get to experience for the first time in the tree, an anti-air vehicle with firepower that rivals or in some instances, is more effective than other nations counterparts. The best way to play with the SIDAM 25 is to play very defensively. Due to it being based on the widespread chassis known as the M113, the SIDAM sadly does not have the best performance on or off road, even a small incline will seriously impact your overall mobility when using the vehicle. It is best to stick to flat ground where your vehicle can be much easier to control. The M113 also does not have the best survivability, so in that the SIDAM also sadly suffers in that area, so it is best to stick with more protected teammates or to flat out stay away from any type of enemy ground vehicles. Artillery will also be able to pressure damage you so in that case you should try your best to move away and avoid getting hit by it in the first place.\n\nIn case any vehicles breach your defenses you do have access to a small amount of APDS rounds, they might be able to deal with lightly armoured vehicles, and for the more heavier and protected vehicles, the APDS will at times penetrate and damage enemy tanks. The SIDAM 25's APDS can penetrate up to 81 mm of armour. Do keep in mind that the APDS is a tier 3 modification so you'll have to research it before having access to it. Due to the very low amount you have access to it is highly advised you use it strictly only for self defense, going on the attack with APDS will not usually work out for you, especially on the SIDAM considering the factors mentioned earlier: being slow, and not having very good mobility, not being very survivable, and overall being a very big target are all downsides for the SIDAM 25. You can negate the APDS shortage by being close to a capture point, as not only will it replenish your main ammunition to keep you focused on shooting down air targets, but it will allow you to be a bit more wild with the APDS, as you'll be able to quickly replenish it easily, to allow you to last longer on the battlefield. So overall for the SIDAM, the best tactic is to try your best to remain or at least be near a capture point.\n\nIn the anti-air sector, the SIDAM 25 sadly does not have access to a radar, unlike other nations' counterparts at the battle rating. What you do have access to however is an optronic tracking system, which allows targets to be tracked, and provides one of the most most accurate lead indicators for any vehicle. This will allow you to predict flight paths of any enemy air vehicles you'll be facing. Another great thing about the optronic system, is that it cannot be detected by radar warning receivers on enemy aircraft, making it much easier for you to target them, and hopefully take them out with a quick barrage of you main gun. Speaking of which, the SIDAM's main armament consists of 4 x 25 mm guns, they have a combined firepower of 2200 rounds per minute; more than enough to deal with most of the aircraft you'll face. You also have access to a two-plane stabilizer, which will furthermore aid you in firefights against both ground and air vehicles.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness.

Its primary goal was to take out out low flying aircraft but it was provided a secondary capability against lightly armoured targets thanks to the types of ammunition it had access to, such as APDS, HEI and SAPHEI. There had been some contenders on what the next anti air vehicle would be, but the Italian Ministry of defense ended up supporting the SIDAM 25 and started to place orders for the vehicle.\n\nThe SIDAM 25 would be based on the American M113 chassis then built under license, mainly it was chosen as it had local production and allowed for a cheap supply of parts and easy maintenance and training. However, to carry the impressive quad system, a large array of modifications had to be carried out including the removal of the single fuel tank replaced with twin tanks either side of the new engine and updated suspension to cope with the increased weight. Although to the outsiders it may look like a decent SPAA (which it is in a way, on a good day), but the actual production version lacked radar and any form of night vision/thermal vision. The SIDAM 25 was advertised at the time to be able to utilize night vision and thermal vision, however there was an issue, cost. The SIDAM 25 project ended up costing Italy too much, so they had to remove things from the actual prototypes such as night vision and the thermal imaging, it ended up having an entirely different turret (the one currently in game). In retrospect Italy could've acquired the OTOMATIC with that money, which although it would lead to less units, it would've been great if they went for quality over quantity.\n\nSadly the SIDAM 25 lived a short life, in total 276 of such systems were produced from 1985, they'd slowly be taken out of active service and put in storage. Most of them have been used for its main armament, and installed onto the Italian army 'Freccia IFV' which uses the same 25 mm the SIDAM once used. The SIDAM 25 would only ever be exported to a private military collector in Belgium, in an estimated 40 units. There was also plans on installing the SIDAM quad mount on another OTO-Melara project, the C-13, however due to political reasons that would not end up happening. In terms of SIDAM upgrades, modernization plans for the SIDAM 25 were drawn up in late 1994. The Italian engineers proposed the up-arming of the vehicle with Matra Mistral surface-to-air missiles in order to give it better long-range capabilities and improve its performance as a whole. Sadly, the Mistral program which aimed to upgrade the Italian SIDAMs would not be picked up.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=it_otobreda_sidam_25 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n== See also ==\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.''\n\n{{TankManufacturer OTO Melara}}\n{{Italy anti-aircraft vehicles}}"}}
