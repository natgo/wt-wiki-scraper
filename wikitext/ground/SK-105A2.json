In most cases, it will stop 20 mm cannons but cannons with a bigger calibre will have no problems punching right trough the hull armour which in most cases leads to an instant death, as the crew is sitting tightly packed together. Rapid firing autocannons such as the ones mounted on the [[Gepard]] or the [[ZSU-37-2]] will have no problems shredding the SK-105 in less than a second. It is highly recommend to not take more than 24 shells due to the fact that reserve shells pile up in the front most part of the tank, which might lead to even more frequent instant deaths. If the user can manage their rounds effectively, the safest ammo count would be 16. This way, only 4 extra rounds are placed into the turret and no rounds are in the front of the tank.\n\n'''Armour type:'''\n\n* Cast homogeneous armour (Front of the turret, Gun mantlet)\n* Rolled homogeneous armour (Hull, Turret roof)\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

It is powered by the Steyr 7FA/6-cylinder turbocharged diesel engine which provides 320 hp (238 kW) for a power-to-weight ratio of 18 hp/ton. While it can go as fast as 59 km/h, one should expect to move at about 40 km/h off-road, however the reserve speed still stays at -9 km/h and it takes roughly 12 seconds for the SK-105 to rotate 360° in neutral steering.\n\n=== Modifications and economy ===\n{{Specs-Economy}}\n\n== Armaments ==\n{{Specs-Tank-Armaments}}\n=== Main armament ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Weapon|1}}\n<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun.

It possesses a 4-second autoloader with a magazine size of 12 rounds. After the 12 rounds were depleted, the user has to wait until the magazine houses at least one round. This can be quite problematic if one is too trigger happy.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"100%\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" | [[PzK M57 (105 mm)|105 mm PzK M57]] || colspan=\"5\" | Turret rotation speed (°/s) || colspan=\"4\" | Reloading rate (seconds)\n|-\n!

Rack 1 is therefore always empty.\n* Rack 3 and 4 (autoloader magazines) are first stage ammo racks. They total 12 shells.\n** These racks get filled first when loading up the tank and are also emptied first.\n** As the {{PAGENAME}} is equipped with an autoloader, manual reloading of the gun is not possible.\n** Once the autoloader magazines have been depleted, you can't shoot until the loader has restocked the autoloader. The restocking time is longer than the normal reload time of the gun. Take this into account when playing.\n** Simply not firing when the gun is loaded will move ammo from rack 2 into rack 4 then 3. Firing will interrupt the restocking of the ready racks.\n** The depletion order at full capacity is: 3 - 4 - 2.\n\n=== Machine guns ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Weapon|2}}\n<!-- ''Offensive and anti-aircraft machine guns not only allow you to fight some aircraft but also are effective against lightly armoured vehicles.

While it lacks any some sort effective penetration, its high rate of fire can dispatch exposed crew members easily. The one, and only, belt houses 1,000 rounds with average velocity. It is largely inadequate against armour and should be used exclusively to dispatch exposed crew members or to destroy environmental objects such as fences with ease.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"50%\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" | [[MG3A1 (7.62 mm)|7.62 mm MG3A1]]\n|-\n!

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\n\nThe SK-105A2 excels at filling the spot as a sniper, due to its very powerful 105 mm cannon, low profile and high mobility. This is all balanced out however by the fact that the SK-105 possesses little to no armour, so any kind of hit from a cannon more powerful than 20 mm, will dispatch the SK-105 quite easily. The user should always check their surrounding as much they can, and as frequently as they can. Finding a vantage point with cover nearby is an effective strategy. Brawls and rushes should generally be avoided and tactics like flanking or sniping should be focused upon as the SK-105 will stand no chance in direct engagements or close quarter fights. However, if one does stumble into a brawl, the 4 second autoloader will prove to be a major benefit coupled with the amazing 105 mm cannon, although one should pay attention to their magazine as the user will not be able to shoot at all if the magazine runs dry completely. It is because of this reason that at least 2 spare rounds should be carried in the magazine in case of an ambush. One big thing to note is that the user also lacks a stabilizer which may be a problem due to the light size of the tank and fast speed, as these properties will make the gun harder to stabilize on its own if the user decides to brake spontaneously.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness.

The very first prototype was built in the year 1967 and it the pre-production began in the year 1971. Around 286 were made for the Austrian Army and was in service until the 1990s, while the rest of the SK-105s were exported.\n\nThe hull of the SK-105 was based on the heavily armoured car, Saurer APC, which was used alongside Austrian units. This allowed the tank destroyer to be light and have above average mobility, something the Austrian Army wanted. While the hull of the tank was an easy choice to make, as the Saurer APC hull required just a few modifications to be adequate for the standards set by the Austrian Army, the debate now was which turret should the SK-105 use. Since the Austrian Army wanted a cannon that was light, reliable yet still powerful enough to fulfil its role of a tank destroyer, they turned their eyes towards France. Because of their massive success and mass production of AMX-13 light tank, the Austrian army decided to contact France in the hopes of designing a new turret. In the end, France agreed and came up with an oscillating turret that was light yet powerful enough to be used in an anti-tank role.\n\nWhile Austria retired the SK-105, a substantial amount is still in service today in other countries: mainly in Brazil, Bolivia and Argentina. Argentina created the \"Patagón\" variant by merging a brand new hull with surplus AMX-13 (105) turrets, the result was a vehicle comparable to the SK-105 A1.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=light_tank&vehicle=fr_sk105_a2 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Images\n<gallery mode=\"packed-hover\" heights=\"150\">\nFile:SK-105A2 Garage Photo.png|SK-105A2 in the garage\n</gallery>\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|G6enBS8bPrU|'''The Shooting Range #267''' - ''Metal Beasts'' section at 00:27 discusses the {{PAGENAME}}.}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n* [[AMX-13]] - Another tank which uses the oscillating turret system that the SK-105 uses\n* [[JaPz.K A2]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wikipedia:SK-105_Kürassier|[Wikipedia] SK-105 Kürassier]]\n* [https://tanks-encyclopedia.com/coldwar/Austria/SK-105_Kurassier.php <nowiki>[tanks-encyclopedia] SK-105 Kurassier</nowiki>]\n\n{{France light tanks}}"}}
