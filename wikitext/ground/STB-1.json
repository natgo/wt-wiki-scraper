In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Japanese medium tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.65 \"Way of the Samurai\"]] along with the initial Japanese Ground Forces tree. The prototype of the [[Type 74]], the STB-1 presents many features that would be in the final design.\n\nThe STB-1 is the second researchable tank in Japan's Ground Forces Rank V. Despite having considerable more armour than its comparable counterparts the Leopard 1 and AMX-30, as well as comparable mobility, it is not recommended as a front-line tank. Instead, a cautious hit-and-run tactic like the Leopards should always be employed. Using the tank's [[hydropneumatic suspension]] correctly can help with the tank's depression, and in some cases, aid in survivability. Do note that the L7 on this tank reloads significantly longer than other L7-equipped tanks.\n\nThe STB-1 is unique in being one of the only Japanese tanks that can take a hit, like the Type 4 Chi-To Late and Ho-Ri Production. It has thick frontal hull armour that can bounce shots effectively, but should not be relied on. The tank is quite fast and is further aided by the Hydropneumatic suspension, which allows this tank to manoeuvre the battlefield much like a Leopard, however the abundance of larger, more open maps at higher ranks means that getting from point A to B - and not getting shot - is not a simple as it sounds.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Armour !! Front !! Sides !! Rear !!

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\nThe STB-1 can be compared to the [[Leopard I]] or even a stock [[Leopard A1A1]], but has its own capabilities in its own right. The STB-1 allows for both a more held down playstyle or aggressive playstyle versus the Leopard I due to its [[Hydropneumatic suspension|hydropneumatic suspension]] and two-plane stabilizer. Together with the power of the engine outfitted on the STB-1, allows it to speedily move to a nice sniper spot or hull-down position and fire at targets before they realize a tank could be there.\n\nThe STB-1 possesses a pretty nice angled upper front plate, but do keep in mind that the STB-1 wasn't designed to take a punch, only to deal a punch, so even with the good angle you shouldn't rely too heavily on it, as shells can penetrate it and won't always bounce off. Do keep this fully in mind especially when taking more shells with the vehicle, as the fuel tank next to the driver will be filled with extra shells, which can blow up the whole tank if a shell does eventually penetrate.\n\nWith the addition of a 12.7 mm machine gun, the STB-1 can make short work of ZSU's or light tanks alike if the heat of the battle doesn't allow for the main gun or in-case of more important targets requiring the main gun's firepower.\n\nWith only 2 shells to choose from being APDS & HESH, APDS can be used for long-distance engagements and HESH can deal with light to medium armoured vehicles with overpressure damage, this can be done at a long range once the laser rangefinder has been unlocked as well. But due to the low velocity of the HESH round it has to be fired at a stationary target at long range to effectively hit.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness.

Known in Japanese as 74式戦車の試作車STB-1 (ななよんしきせんしゃのしさくしゃSTB-1). Created in September 1969 along with STB-2 in the STT program. Due to issues with cost effectiveness these two prototypes were not considered for the replacement of the Type 61. In a bid to reduce costs STB-3, STB-4, STB-5 and STB-6 were produced between April 1970 to December 1971. The final judgement for the STT program was held in November 1973 which lead the line to be completed in 1974. And, production started the following year in 1975 for the [[Type 74]].\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=jp_st_b1 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|GgC8UNa8dok|'''Leopard I vs STB-1''' - ''War Thunder Official Channel''|p6cWlyUnJQA|'''Top 7 off-road beasts'''  discusses the {{PAGENAME}} at 2:46  - ''War Thunder Official Channel''|PosWOnOGkSo|'''Best experimental vehicles''' discusses the {{PAGENAME}} at 6:11 - ''War Thunder Official Channel''}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n;[[Type 74 (Family)|Related Development]]\n\n* [[Type 74 (C)]] - <small>(Early Production version)</small>\n* [[Type 74 (E)]] - <small>(Variant with improved FCS & thermal sleeve)</small>\n* [[Type 74 (F)]] - <small>(Variant with mounting plates for a Type 92 mine-roller)</small>\n* [[Type 74 (G)]] - <small>(Improved ({{Annotation|改|Kai}}) variant with thermal and armor skirts)</small>\n\n;Other vehicles of similar configuration and role\n\n* [[Leopard I]]\n* [[AMX-30]]\n* [[AMX-30 (1972)]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wt:en/news/4459-profile-stb-1-steel-ninja-en/|[Profile] STB-1: Steel Ninja]]\n\n{{Japan medium tanks}}"}}
