In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium rank {{Specs|rank}} Soviet tank destroyer {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.51 \"Cold Steel\"]]. A rather large profile tank destroyer on-par with the [[KV-2 (1939)|KV-2]], but with a much more powerful 130 mm naval cannon, it serves well as a defensive vehicle against an offensive force.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection.

Bad armour, bad mobility, but amazing firepower. Just park the tank in a position where the SU-100Y will be difficult to flank. That way when the vehicles do fire the gun, it can immediately run and hide while the gun reloads. It can not be emphasized enough, this tank can not let itself get shot at. It just doesn't have the armour. But once ready to let one of the 130 mm shells loose, this tank fears few.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as \"bad\", \"good\" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as \"inadequate\" and \"effective\".'' -->\n\n'''Pros:'''\n\n* The SU-100Y's B-13 cannon is one of the more powerful guns at its rank, able to penetrate ~200 mm of armour at 500 m and enemy tanks rarely bounce the shell\n* Astounding 2.35 kg of TNT explosive filler in the PB-46A APHE shell that can reliably knock out tanks with a single shot\n* With 5 degrees of gun depression, the SU-100Y has better gun depression than nearly every other Soviet tank destroyer\n* The SU-100Y has a very powerful engine, accelerating to its top speed and maintaining it even while going uphill is no problem\n* Six-man crew spread out across the vehicle gives this tank a decent chance of surviving a penetrating shell\n* Has a research point and Silver Lions boost as a premium vehicle\n\n'''Cons:'''\n\n* Skilled players will recognize the threat a SU-100Y poses - expect to be the centre of the enemy's attention\n* This is a huge tank, finding decent cover or a good ambush location is difficult at best\n* Sub-par armour - every gun that this tank can face poses a serious threat\n* Extremely vulnerable cannon breech and barrel. Problematic as a single hit to them will result in them being in critical condition\n* With a terrible manoeuvrability, a mediocre reverse speed and a massive size, dodging enemy fire is nearly impossible\n* Even a good crew will take more than 20 seconds to reload the gun\n\n== History ==\n<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction.

This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->\n===Development===\nAfter the failure of the vehicle from testing in the Winter War, the T-100, along with the [[SMK]], fell back into the drawing boards along with other designs that didn't make the cut. But in December 1939, the Red Army requested that Factory No. 185 produce a vehicle based on the failed T-100 chassis. The specifications were for the vehicle to not only operate as a self-propelled gun but in a multitude of roles such as a bridge layer, explosive transporter, and tank recovery.\n\nDevelopment started with the proposal to mount the 152 mm cannon onto the T-100 in order to be able to combat fortifications like the [[KV-2 (1939)|KV-2]] with the same armament. The factory manager instead proposed the mounting of a 100 or 130 mm naval gun onto the vehicle instead, and this proposal was accepted on January 8, 1940. The designs, designated ''T-100-X'', was sent to the Izhorskyi factory. At that moment, the T-100-X had a box-shaped fighting compartment with a 130 mm B-13 naval gun. The vehicle had a torsion-bar suspension to stay mobile. Over time, the prototype was redesigned with a modified fighting compartment and such and was resubmitted to the factory for production on February 24, 1940, and redesignated as the '''SU-100Y'''. The produced design was tested in March, but the design was dropped from production due to the low demand and the ending of the Winter War. This leaves the SU-100Y with only one prototype ever built. Other methods to either modernize the T-100 or into other variants were made in complementary to the SU-100Y, such as mounting the 152 mm M-10 gun and designating it the T-100-Z. This idea never went past the drawing boards as the success of the [[KV-1 (ZiS-5)|KV-1]] and KV-2s proved the designs unnecessary. Another idea was to use the T-100 as coastal defence weapon with the 130 mm gun on a turret than a casemate structure, along with three machine guns, like the T-100-Z, this didn't pass the drawing boards.\n\n===Service===\nThe SU-100Y prototype was sent to Kubinka in 1940 once the project stopped, however in the Battle of Moscow in 1941, the SU-100Y and its T-100 self-propelled variants SU-14 and SU-14-1 were pressed into service in the Independent Artillery Division for Special Duties. Combat records for these units are not known, but it left the SU-100Y in intact shape, allowing it to be preserved today in the Kubinka Tank Museum.\n\n=== In-game description ===\nThe SU-100Y heavy SPG was built on a modified chassis of the experimental T-100 tank on which a new cabin with a 130 mm B-13 navy gun had been installed. An experimental model was assembled at Factory #185 in March, 1940. Because combat operations on the USSR-Finnish front had ended, testing the new SPG in combat conditions was impossible. After undergoing tests, the vehicle was sent to the NII BTT research institute testing ground in Kubinka. Further work on this vehicle was abandoned.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=ussr_su_100Y Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|VFEv4q3G5Us|'''Most unusual vehicles'''  discusses the {{PAGENAME}} at 1:44  - ''War Thunder Official Channel''|hCcfQZNsjmU|'''{{PAGENAME}} Tank Review''' - ''NUSensei''}}\n\n== See also ==\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wt:en/devblog/current/800|[Devblog] Ki-44-1 and SU-100Y]]\n\n{{TankManufacturer OKMO}}\n{{USSR tank destroyers}}\n{{USSR premium ground vehicles}}"}}
