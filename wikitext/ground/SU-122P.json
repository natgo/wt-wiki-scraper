In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium rank {{Specs|rank}} Soviet tank destroyer {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.41]].\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->\n\nThe armour and survivability of the SU-122P is poor. At its BR, the 75 mm sloped upper front plate is very much useless as most opponents you face have more than 150 mm of penetration which is more than enough to go through your front. You will also more frequently see tanks firing HEAT shells (eg. [[ST-A1]], [[T114]]) who can just ignore your armour. The side armour is non existent. The only vehicles that cannot frontally penetrate you are SPAA (eg. [[M42 (Family)|M42]], [[Kugelblitz]]) and lower tier tanks. These vehicles are however quite rare, and often the foes will not struggle to penetrate you.\n\nPost-penetration survivability is bad, since the interior of the SU-122P is cramped and the crew members are closely sat. Late-war/Cold War heavy tanks/tank destroyers (eg. [[T30]]) usually fire explosive-packed large-calibre APHE which can always one-shot you easily. However enemies with HEAT shells might take a few more shots to finish you as the damage of HEAT are lower.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Armour !! Front (Slope angle) !! Sides !! Rear !!

Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->\n\n{{tankMobility|abMinHp=710|rbMinHp=442}}\n\nThe mobility of the SU-122P is on par with average medium tanks/tank destroyers at similar BR (eg. [[T-44]], [[T25]]). While the top speed is 50 km/h, the average speed on common terrains (eg. grassland, dirt) is around ~30 km/h, which is usually enough to keep up with advancing teammates. The acceleration on soft surface or on a hill might feel sluggish, though. Hull traverse rate is adequate on all types of terrain, but a slight forward jerk might be required if the player wants to turn the hull quicker. The reverse speed is very slow at only -8 km/h while other late-war/Cold War-era vehicles are much faster. All in all, the SU-122P is not the fastest nor the most agile vehicle, but it will get to the places it needs to go in time.\n\n=== Modifications and economy ===\n{{Specs-Economy}}\n\n== Armaments ==\n{{Specs-Tank-Armaments}}\n=== Main armament ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Weapon|1}}\n<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun. Assess its effectiveness in a battle based on the reloading speed, ballistics and the power of shells.

Add a link to the main article on the gun: <code><nowiki>{{main|Name of the weapon}}</nowiki></code>. Describe in general terms the ammunition available for the main gun. Give advice on how to use them and how to fill the ammunition storage.'' -->\n{{main|D-25S (122 mm)}}\n\nThe SU-122P is equipped with a classic 122 mm D-25S cannon that is very capable even against Cold War vehicles. At this rank, the player should feel comfortable with the long reload of such gun and should master its ballistics and shell velocity. Plus the reload of ~18 seconds is much shorter than earlier tanks with 122 mm guns. If every shell counts, the 122 mm cannon is a very deadly terminator. The recommended ammo is of course the BR-471B and BR-471D. The former is a perfect option against late-WW2 vehicles such as [[Panther II]], [[M26 (Family)|M26]], etc, while the latter is more for super-heavy/Cold War tanks like the [[Tortoise]], [[T30]], etc. These shells all have great post-penetration damage and thus can generally one-shot most opponents.\n\nThis fantastic firepower is somewhat limited by the gun's aiming speed and traverse angles. The horizontal aiming speed of around 6 degree/s is somewhat enough for medium range engagements but will feel slow in close range battle against fast tanks like the [[M41 (Family)|M41]] and [[AUBL/74]]. The vertical targeting speed is much slower, and the gun depression of only -2 degrees makes it one of the worst vehicle in game at fighting in sloped terrains. A tiny hill will lift the nozzle up from the target. Finally, the gunsight zoom remains the same 3.5x which is just enough for medium range combat.\n\nNote that since the gun is mounted towards the right side of the SU-122P, so when you aim and shoot to the left the tank will turn slightly to the right due to the huge recoil.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"100%\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" | [[D-25S (122 mm)|122 mm D-25S]] || colspan=\"5\" | Turret rotation speed (°/s) || colspan=\"4\" | Reloading rate (seconds)\n|-\n!

The large 122 mm calibre of your shells will result in it catching on an armour plate's edge very often, losing all of its penetration. For example, a Tiger I has some edges that can absorb your shell unexpectedly, despite having flat armour. Thus you must always make sure that where you are aiming at is absolutely free of obstruction, or it may result in a non-penetration or a ricochet. This can be seen in the diagram to the right.\n\n==== Specific Enemies Worth Noting ====\n\n* [[T28]] - You can only penetrate the cupolas on top of the tank. If they're hidden or you are unsure about the shot, you can try hitting the cannon barrel and running away.\n* [[T34]] / [[T29]] - Turret cheeks can work, although it's best to go for the LFP because the ammo storage is very low in the tank. If you don't see the LFP, try going just below the turret ring, where the driver sits.\n* [[Tiger II (H)]] / [[Panther II]] - You can easily penetrate the turret cheeks with BR-471B.\n* [[Ferdinand]] - Go for the angled armour at the sides of the lower front plate (below the casemate, but above the lowest plates), this will disable Ferdinand's engine and/or driver, so you can flank and finish it off.\n* [[Panther tank (Family)]], versions A, D, F and G - You can penetrate the UFP\n* [[Tortoise]] - Shoot to the right of the gun of the Tortoise, when you see it head-on if shoot on the left plate there is a chance of a one-shot\n* [[Ho-Ri Production]] - You cannot reliably penetrate or damage this tank frontally. You can try disabling the cannon barrel and then flanking is your best option (or running).\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness.

Uralmash's Design Bureau offered a tank destroyer on the same SU-100 hull, but with a 122 mm D-25S anti-tank gun. The 122 mm gun could be fitted without modification due to the commonality of the gun mounts.\n\nTrials of the new tank destroyer, called the SU-122P, began in October 1944. Afterwards, it was sent to Government trials, passing all of them. It was recommended for service, but it never entered production, partially because of the long reload time of the 122 mm gun.\n\n=== In-game description ===\nA new SPG, designated SU-122P, was designed in the spring of 1944. Its designers attempted to fit the previously developed SU-100 SPG with a powerful 122 mm D-25S cannon with the aim of increasing the SPG's firepower. Outwardly, this SPG differed from the SU-100 in that its barrel was longer and had a muzzle brake.\n\nIn September 1944, the SU-122P SPG underwent factory testing, which it passed successfully. In spite of this, the order to put it into mass production did not follow. There were several reasons for this decision. First of all, the 122 mm D-25S cannon's penetration was lower than that of the D-10S by 4-5 mm, and its ammunition capacity was reduced to 26.\n\nDue to its separate loading, its rate of fire was reduced to 3-4 shots per minute, and the weapon's recoil was higher than that of the SU-100's, which negatively affected the undercarriage's durability. The previous issues of inadequate space in the fighting compartment had remained unsolved. In addition, SPGs with a similar cannon had already been designed based on the IS-2, which had a more suitable chassis, hull and cabin for heavy artillery weapons.\n\nOnly 1 experimental SU-122P SPG was produced.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=ussr_su_122P Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n;Vehicles equipped with the same chassis\n* [[SU-122]]\n* [[SU-85]]\n* [[SU-85M]]\n* [[SU-100]]\n\n== External links ==\n''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.''\n\n{{USSR tank destroyers}}\n{{USSR premium ground vehicles}}"}}
