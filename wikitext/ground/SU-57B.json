{"title":"SU-57B","pageid":2595,"wikitext":{"*":"{{Specs-Card\n|code=ussr_su_57b\n|images={{Specs-Card-Image|GarageImage_{{PAGENAME}}.jpg}}\n}}\n\n== Description ==\n<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Soviet tank destroyer {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.83 \"Masters of the Sea\"]].\n\nThis tank destroyer uses a 57 mm ZIS-4 for its main gun. It features a low profile, good top speed (40 km/h in RB) and great penetration for its rank, but weak armour at all angles.\n\nThe overall design of the SU-57B allows for sneaky attacks, revolving around the 57 mm ZiS-4 gun that allows for engagement from medium range on unsuspecting enemies. Because of its low profile, this TD can use bushes and terrain to hide its approach. However, the trade-off is lacklustre mobility, so it compares with the ZiS-30 that provides better mobility and speed and can reposition much faster. Despite all these limitations, when played right the SU-57B can score good scores, but only when properly positioned and not detected.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->\nThe SU-57B has the best armour on the front, weaker armour on the sides and on the rear. Regarding the crew protection, because of the number of crew members (4), the loss of 1 or 2 crew members is acceptable. But due to the thin armour, the SU-57B can take one or two shots maximum before being put out of order. It is much better protected than the ZiS-30 and can sustain MG fire.\n\n'''Armour type:'''\n\n* Rolled homogeneous armour\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Armour !! Front (Slope angle) !! Sides !!

Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->\n\n{{tankMobility|abMinHp= 148|rbMinHp= 92}}\n\nThe {{PAGENAME}} is sluggish at backwards speed and will have a hard time countering an opponent attempting a flanking manoeuvre. The best bet is to retreat and relocate when spotted. Fortunately, thanks to its great forward speed (43 km/h maximum), the {{PAGENAME}} can still move quite easily.\n\n=== Modifications and economy ===\n{{Specs-Economy}}\n\n== Armaments ==\n{{Specs-Tank-Armaments}}\n=== Main armament ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Weapon|1}}\n<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun. Assess its effectiveness in a battle based on the reloading speed, ballistics and the power of shells.

Add a link to the main article on the gun: <code><nowiki>{{main|Name of the weapon}}</nowiki></code>. Describe in general terms the ammunition available for the main gun. Give advice on how to use them and how to fill the ammunition storage.'' -->\n{{main|ZIS-4 (57 mm)}}\n\nThe main gun is ridiculously powerful for its hull. It features a ZIS-4 57 mm that has a penetration rate similar to the ZiS-30 main gun. The position of the main gun is quite low and enemies will have a hard time detecting the silhouette of the tank. However, because of its long barrel, one must be careful not to stand out from cover or from the sides.\n\nThe recoil of the gun can be important and must be taken care of, as well as the dispersion effect. The relatively fast reloading rate of 6.5 seconds allows for a comfortable targeting and efficiency. Though, with the SU-57B able to hold a total of 72 rounds of ammunition, the SU-57B can shoot more freely without worry. However, keep in mind the 6.5 seconds initial reload time can be quite long when facing an opponent at close range.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"100%\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" | [[ZIS-4 (57 mm)|57 mm ZIS-4]] || colspan=\"5\" | Turret rotation speed (°/s) || colspan=\"4\" | Reloading rate (seconds)\n|-\n!

But even with its light armour it got a useful acceleration and top speed makes it a opponent to be wary against. A well placed or hidden Su-57B can with ease prove to be a great obstacle for the enemy armoured units.\n\nA key element to the Su-57B being used successfully is distance to enemy targets and element of surprise, the ZiS-4 is a gun that can attack most vehicles at any distance on the field, with a powerful and fast firing 57 mm long barrel it can ambush from distance as from close range. Why distance is a key for the Su-57B is its lack of armour, being 25 mm frontally thick but at an angle that gives it an effective armour of 32 mm makes it an easy target for most vehicles it will face. At a distance it has a higher possibility to survive a hit and maintain a distance to enemy 12.7 mm machine guns.\n\nGround units are one of the Su-57B's least worries, enemy air units can easily target the Su-57B from above, having a light top armour makes most machine gun fire and cannon fire from planes a lethal threat. Lacking a anti-air machine gun on it, makes it hard for it to defend itself against air units. Hiding in forests or bushes are a way for it to defend itself form aircrafts.  Protection against air can also be near allied SPAA vehicles.\n\nEnemies to be aware of is mostly heavy tanks like [[Churchill III]] and light tanks that can easily flank it like [[Sd.Kfz.234/2]] and [[M5A1]], SPAA like [[M15A1 CGMC]], [[Wirbelwind]], [[R3 T20 FA-HS]] and [[ZSD63]] will have a easy time destroying the light armour.  But most important of all is that it's extremely vulnerable to any air attack against it, you can with ease prevent ground units to get into a effective range, Air units can attack from anywhere and easily make scrap metal out of the Su-57B\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness.

One named \"GAZ-74b\" which is the SU-57B with a long barrel, and an improved version with a 76 mm gun.The Su-57a was to be the tank hunter with the 76mm main gun. The Su-57B was not accepted for service because it was too costly pro produce and because of its newer diesel engine.\n\nLater the GAZ-74d (SU-76d) would come out with a 76 mm S-1 main gun and a frontal armour of 60 mm. It will also be known later as \"SU-80\".\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=ussr_su_57b Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Images\n<div><ul>\n<li style=\"display: inline-block;\"> [[File:SU-57B Intro.jpg|thumb|none|300px|{{PAGENAME}} driving around Stalingrad]] </li>\n</ul></div>\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|BzpVk-wmM0w|'''SU-57B, Soviet, Tier-3, Tank Destroyer''' - ''Angry Nerd Gaming''}}\n\n== See also ==\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [http://www.wardrawings.be/WW2/Files/1-Vehicles/Allies/2-USSR/05-TankDestroyers/RussianHetzer/File/Russian-Hetzer.htm [War Drawings<nowiki>]</nowiki> Russian Hetzer Tank Destroyer]\n* [http://english.battlefield.ru/tanks/14-experimental/63-russian-hetzer.html [Battlefield<nowiki>.ru]</nowiki> Russian 'Hetzer']\n\n{{USSR tank destroyers}}"}}
