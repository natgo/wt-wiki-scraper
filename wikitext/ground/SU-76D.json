In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium gift rank {{Specs|rank}} Soviet tank destroyer {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced during [[Update \"Ixwa Strike\"]] as a reward for the [[wt:en/news/7107-event-future-technology-en|Future Technology]] event.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->\nThe SU-76D has almost no armour to speak of, and can only survive one or two shells before getting knocked out. Because of this, it should be played like a light tank. Also, its roof armour is enough for .50 cal machine guns to penetrate. Luckily it has a relatively low profile so getting hit is a bit harder, and it can sustain small-calibre MG fire.\n\n'''Armour type:'''\n\n* Rolled homogeneous armour (hull, casemate)\n* Cast homogeneous armour (cupola)\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
