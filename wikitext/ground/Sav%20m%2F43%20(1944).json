In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Swedish tank destroyer {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.97 \"Viking Fury\"]].\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->\nThe Sav m/43 has up to 50 mm of armour in front, which is capable of deflecting some guns commonly encountered but is still vulnerable to larger calibres. It has better frontal protection than the [[Ikv 72]], but is still rather lightly armoured from other angles. The engine deck is only 10 mm thick, and can be penetrated by aircraft heavy machine guns and cannons. The side armour is only 15 mm thick at most, and can also be penetrated quite easily by heavy machins guns and autocannon fire. Due to the cramped crew compartment and scattered ammunition within the compartment, any penetration by a shell is likely to cause critical damage to multiple modules and/or crew members.\n\n'''Armour type:''' <!-- The types of armour present on the vehicle and their general locations -->\n<!-- Example: * Rolled homogeneous armour (Front, Side, Rear, Hull roof)\n* Cast homogeneous armour (Turret, Transmission area) -->\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->\n\n{{tankMobility|abMinHp= 227|rbMinHp= 142}}\n\nThe Sav m/43 is based on the chassis of the [[Strv m/41 S-II|Strv m/41]] and thus has a similar level of mobility. It is considerably heavier, however, and thus correspondingly more sluggish. While the forward top speed is adequate, the reverse speed is quite poor, making it hard to retreat. It is also noticeably slower than the [[Ikv 72]].\n\n=== Modifications and economy ===\n{{Specs-Economy}}\n\n== Armaments ==\n{{Specs-Tank-Armaments}}\n=== Main armament ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Weapon|1}}\n<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun.

Give advice on how to use them and how to fill the ammunition storage.'' -->\n{{main|kan m/02 (75 mm)}}\n\nThe Sav m/43 is armed with the 7,5 cm kan m/02, an older and weaker 75 mm field gun compared to that used in the [[Ikv 72]]. It has wider traverse arcs and higher maximum elevation, but less gun depression than the Ikv 72, though still quite good at -10 degrees. It starts off with the unremarkable '''slpprj m/40''' uncapped AP shot, which is adequate against most opposition it may encounter but tends to suffer ricochets against sloped armour. However, once upgraded, the gun may fire the '''slpgr m/39''' uncapped APHE shell and the '''slpprj m/40B''' APBC shot. The former round has a very lethal 260 g TNT filler but tends to ricochet more and has less penetration, while the latter has better penetration and ricochets less, and is thus more useful in uptiers. It is recommended to carry a mixture of both APHE and APBC unless the Sav m/43 is top tier, in which case the APHE alone is sufficient.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"100%\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" | [[kan m/02 (75 mm)|75 mm kan m/02]] || colspan=\"5\" | Turret rotation speed (°/s) || colspan=\"4\" | Reloading rate (seconds)\n|-\n!

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\n\nThe Sav m/43 (1944) is a more forgiving alternative to the [[Ikv 72]]. Like the Ikv 72, it performs best in a hull-down position, as it can use the depression to present a steeper angle on the frontal armour to increase its effective thickness. It has a relatively weak armour from the sides, top and rear, even if less vulnerable than the Ikv 72. It is best to play this vehicle cautiously since it has a slower manoeuvrability than the Ikv 72.\n\nThe armour on its own is adequate enough to survive most hits to the frontal armour at this battle rating, but leaving its side and rear exposed to enemies will make a quick work of it. Hence, it's a good support role vehicle to help allied vehicles by either finishing the enemies off or drawing attention to itself with the frontal armour so other allied vehicles avoid being targeted. Against heavier armoured vehicles or just vehicles with better guns such as [[M3 Lee]] and [[B1 ter]], it's better to avoid direct confrontation and not fight on equal terms.\n\nWhile the gun is quite adequate against most enemies at its battle rating, it can be seen obsolete in uptiers where it will face opponents with considerably more armour. The gun might not be efficient in an uptier but it can still do damage if resorting to ambushing and shooting from hills, using the angled armour and the depression of the gun to its advantage. It can lock down areas and buy time for allied tanks to come to its aid doing flanking manoeuvres. The Sav m/43 (1944) can also move around to flank heavier armoured vehicles, getting to their side armour will give it a chance to penetrate and the ability to disable the better protected tanks when frontal engagement is not a viable option.\n\n'''Enemies worth noting:'''\n\n[[M4A3 (105)]] - The M4A3 (1059 is a dangerous vehicle for the SAV m/43 (1944) to encounter, angled armour making the shells of the [[Kan m/02 (75 mm)|Kan m/02]] next to unusable against its angled frontal armour. It also got a gun with a HEAT shell that will make quick work of the Sav's armour and most likely detonate the ammunition or knock out the crew if it gets a good shot on the Sav. Best to stay away or ambush it where it shows off its less armoured and flat side armour.\n\n[[B1 ter]] - The B1 Ter has an armour thick enough that it can ignore the penetration capability of the SAV m/43's rounds, lacking in firepower compared to vehicles like [[M4A3 (105)]] or [[M3 Lee]], it can still do quite the damage with the 47 mm gun in the turret. Best way to eliminate this type of target is to either hit the less armoured turret or get a hit in the flat armoured rear.\n\n[[M3 Lee]] - Similar to M4A3 (105), the M3 Lee's armour can prove to be quite resilient against the SAV m/43 (1944)'s shells forcing it to avoid the direct confrontation with the M3 Lee. The Lee is not just a well armoured medium tank, it also got a 75 mm anti-tank gun and a 37 mm gun in a turret which can prove to be efficient against the SAV m/43's armour. Making it a lethal opponent to face aswel, where the best chance is to catch one off guard on the side or rear and attack the weaker side or rear armour.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness.

Avoid using categorical definitions such as \"bad\", \"good\" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as \"inadequate\" and \"effective\".'' -->\n\n'''Pros:'''\n\n* Decent frontal armour in a downtier\n* Lethal APHE round, able to frontally penetrate and knock out almost any tank it faces with a single shot\n* Wide gun traverse arc and good gun depression allows turret to acquire target without requiring constant adjustment of the hull\n* Decent top speed\n* Has smoke shells which can \"lock down\" an enemy area by shooting smoke shells there\n* Adequate reload speed\n* Has small silhouette\n\n'''Cons:'''\n\n* Low penetration works poorly against heavy targets such as [[M4A3 (105)]], [[B1 ter]]\n* Very thin side, rear, and roof armour\n* Very slow shell velocity, leading and shooting fast tanks (e.g. [[M22]], [[BT-5]]) is hard\n* Curved shell trajectory demands precise aiming at long range\n* Shells have weak penetration past 500 m\n* Mediocre mobility and poor reverse speed\n\n== History ==\n<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction.

S. Sweden still needed the light tanks, and after negotiations the Swedish manufacturer Scania-Vabis was allowed to produce them under license, and compensation for the lost tanks. Sweden ordered 116 Strv M/41 SI in June, 1941, and in June of 1942 Sweden ordered 122 Strv M/41 SII. The last 18 Strv M/41 SII were built as the Sav M/43 in 1944. Another 18 Sav M/43 were purpose-built afterwards. The Sav M/43 was a casemate assault gun made by removing the turret of the Strv M/41, and adding a casemate superstructure, initially housing a 75 mm gun. The 75 mm gun was replaced by a 105 mm M/44 Bofors cannon. The Sav M/43 served in artillery units until 1951, when they were given to armoured units instead. They served until 1973.\n\n=== [[wt:en/news/6595-development-stormartillerivagn-m-43-en|Devblog]] ===\nIn 1942, Sweden began developing a new SPG built on a modified chassis from the Czech LT vz.38, better known as the Pz.38(t) in the German army. This new SPG was supposed to be equipped with the 75 mm L/31 cannon that was already in production. By autumn of 1942, a wooden model of the planned vehicle had been created and, after a number of improvements, the project advanced to manufacturing prototypes. Exactly one year later, in October of 1943, testing began. The SPG passed with flying colours and hit assembly lines under the designation Sav m/43 (short for \"Stormartillerivagn\", Swedish for \"assault artillery carriage\"). A little later, a version with a 105 mm gun came out, and, by the end of 1946, all m/43 SPGs had been re-equipped with this new cannon. The Swedish army had used this SPG until the early 70s. From the moment it entered military service until the end of the Second World War in Europe, the Sav m/43 vehicles were grouped by the Norwegian border and then assigned to infantry units as fire-support vehicles when the army was reorganised.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=sw_sav_m43_1944 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Images\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"150\">\nFile:Sav m 43 1944 WTWallpaper 01.jpg\nFile:Sav m 43 1944 WTWallpaper 02.jpg\nFile:Sav m 43 1944 WTWallpaper 03.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n{{main|LT-38 (Family)}}\n;Vehicles equipped with the same chassis\n* [[Strv m/41 S-I]]\n* [[Strv m/41 S-II]]\n;Related development\n* [[Spj fm/43-44]]\n* [[Sav m/43 (1946)]]\n* [[Pvkv II]]\n* [[Pbv 301]]\n;Other vehicles of similar configuration and role\n* [[StuG III A]]\n* [[SU-76M]]\n* [[M8 HMC (China)|M8 HMC]]\n* [[75/18 M41]]\n* [[SAu 40]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n=== References ===\n;Bibliography\n* Stormartillerivagn m/43.
