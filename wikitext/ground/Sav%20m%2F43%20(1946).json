Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Swedish tank destroyer {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.97 \"Viking Fury\"]].\n\nThe Sav m/43 (1946) is essentially identical to the [[Sav m/43 (1944)]] with the important exception of the gun: instead of the 75 mm field gun, it features a 105 mm howitzer.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->\nThe Sav m/43 (1946) has up to 50 mm of armour in front, which is capable of deflecting shots if angled, but should not be relied on. It should be noted that the engine deck is only 10 mm thick, and can be penetrated by aircraft heavy machine guns and cannon. The side armour is only 15 mm thick at most, and can also be penetrated quite easily by heavy machine guns and autocannon fire.\n\nDue to the cramped crew compartment and scattered ammunition within the compartment, any penetration by a shell is likely to cause critical damage to multiple modules and/or crew members.\n\n'''Armour type:'''\n\n* Rolled homogeneous armour\n* Cast homogeneous armour\n* Structural steel\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Armour\n!Front (Slope angle)\n!Sides\n!Rear\n!Roof\n|-\n|Hull\n|50 mm (24°) ''Crew Compartment''<br>30 mm (64°) ''Upper Glacis''<br>50 mm (15°) ''Lower Glacis''<br>15 mm (61°) ''Lower Plate (Between L.

Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->\n\n{{tankMobility|abMinHp=202|rbMinHp=142}}\n\nThe Sav m/43 is based on the chassis of the [[Strv m/41 S-II|Strv m/41]] and thus has a similar level of mobility. It is considerably heavier, however, and thus correspondingly more sluggish. While the forward top speed is adequate, the reverse speed is quite poor, making it hard to retreat.\n\n=== Modifications and economy ===\n{{Specs-Economy}}\n\n== Armaments ==\n{{Specs-Tank-Armaments}}\n=== Main armament ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Weapon|1}}\n<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun.

Add a link to the main article on the gun: <code><nowiki>{{main|Name of the weapon}}</nowiki></code>. Describe in general terms the ammunition available for the main gun. Give advice on how to use them and how to fill the ammunition storage.'' -->\n{{main|kan m/44 (105 mm)}}\n\nThe 1946 model of the Sav m/43 now features the '''10,5 cm kan m/44''', a 105 mm howitzer. It starts off with the very inadequate '''slpprj m/44''' APBC round. This round lacks the penetration or post-penetration damage to be competitive against the tanks the Sav m/43 faces; thus, it is of the utmost importance that the '''psgr m/49''' HEAT shell is unlocked as soon as possible. This round has an amazing 240 mm of penetration, the most of any round available to any Rank II tank in the game, and also has substantially better post-penetration effects than ones of the competition. \n\nThere is also an HE round available that is actually effective against most light tanks and medium tank roofs, but landing a fatal overpressure shot on a medium tank is difficult, especially in RB. In AB, HE shell is the only one that can consistently take out tanks in a single hit, assuming it does hit a weak spot.\n\nThe shells all have a relatively low muzzle velocity, and it can therefore be quite hard to hit moving targets at long range. Conversely, the substantial arc of the shell trajectories due to the low-velocity shells allows the Sav m/43 to sometimes hit targets hiding behind cover, or to fire from behind cover itself.\n\nThe heavier shells also result in a relatively long loading time compared to the 1944 model's 75 mm field gun.\n\nOne interesting quirk of the gun is that it is not mounted onto the vehicle pointing directly forward. In fact, the gun is, by default, pointing around 15° to the left, giving it more horizontal traverse to that side.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"100%\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" | [[kan m/44 (105 mm)|105 mm kan m/44]] || colspan=\"5\" | Turret rotation speed (°/s) || colspan=\"4\" | Reloading rate (seconds)\n|-\n!

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\nLike the preceding 1944 model, the Sav m/43 (1946) performs best in hull down positions, as it can use the gun depression to present a steeper angle on the frontal armour to increase its effective thickness. However, it commonly faces tougher opposition at this BR, including the very common [[T-34 (Family)|T-34]], [[M4A1]], and [[Pz.IV F2]] medium tanks, thus the armour should not be depended on in a slugging match against these tanks.\n\nConversely, the 240 mm penetration on the HEAT round is capable of dealing with anything the Sav m/43 can encounter, even the heaviest of tanks. Hitting accurately with the low velocity shells will take practice, but since HEAT shells do not lose penetration with distance, the Sav m/43 is capable of crippling or destroying even the heaviest tanks at long range.\n\nThe side and rear armour is very thin (10-15 mm), and is very vulnerable to even heavy machine gun and autocannon fire. Exposing it to the enemy will lead to a quick demise, especially against the extremely common .50 cal M2 heavy machine gun found on a lot of American tanks.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness.

S. Sweden still needed the light tanks, and after negotiations the Swedish manufacturer Scania-Vabis was allowed to produce them under license, and compensation for the lost tanks. Sweden ordered 116 Strv M/41 SI in June, 1941, and in June of 1942 Sweden ordered 122 Strv M/41 SII. The last 18 Strv M/41 SII were built as the Sav M/43 in 1944. Another 18 Sav M/43 were purpose-built afterwards. The Sav M/43 was a casemate assault gun made by removing the turret of the Strv M/41, and adding a casemate superstructure, initially housing a 75 mm gun. The 75 mm gun was replaced by a 105 mm M/44 Bofors cannon. The Sav M/43 served in artillery units until 1951, when they were given to armoured units instead. They served until 1973.\n\n=== [[wt:en/news/6595-development-stormartillerivagn-m-43-en|Devblog]] ===\nIn 1942, Sweden began developing a new SPG built on a modified chassis from the Czech LT vz.38, better known as the Pz.38(t) in the German army. This new SPG was supposed to be equipped with the 75mm L/31 cannon that was already in production. By autumn of 1942, a wooden model of the planned vehicle had been created and, after a number of improvements, the project advanced to manufacturing prototypes. Exactly one year later, in October of 1943, testing began. The SPG passed with flying colours and hit assembly lines under the designation Sav m/43 (short for \"Stormartillerivagn\", Swedish for \"assault artillery carriage\"). A little later, a version with a 105mm gun came out, and, by the end of 1946, all m/43 SPGs had been re-equipped with this new cannon. The Swedish army had used this SPG until the early 70's. From the moment it entered military service until the end of the Second World War in Europe, the Sav m/43 vehicles were grouped by the Norwegian border and then assigned to infantry units as fire-support vehicles when the army was reorganised.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=sw_sav_m43_1946 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Images\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"150\">\nFile:Sav m 43 1946 WTWallpaper 01.jpg|\nFile:Sav m 43 1946 WTWallpaper 02.jpg|\nFile:Sav m 43 1946 WTWallpaper 03.jpg|\n</gallery>\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|4_cJ1CpEatw|'''Best gun depression'''  discusses the {{PAGENAME}} at 0:51 - ''War Thunder Official Channel''}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n{{main|LT-38 (Family)}}\n;Vehicles equipped with the same chassis\n* [[Strv m/41 S-I]]\n* [[Strv m/41 S-II]]\n;Related development\n* [[Spj fm/43-44]]\n* [[Sav m/43 (1944)]]\n* [[Pvkv II]]\n* [[Pbv 301]]\n;Other vehicles of similar configuration and role\n* [[StuG III A]]\n* [[SU-76M]]\n* [[M8 HMC (China)|M8 HMC]]\n* [[75/18 M41]]\n* [[SAu 40]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wt:en/news/6595-development-stormartillerivagn-m-43-en|[Devblog] Stormartillerivagn m/43]]\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n\n* Stormartillerivagn m/43.
