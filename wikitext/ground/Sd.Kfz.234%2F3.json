In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium gift rank {{Specs|rank}} German tank destroyer {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced during [[Update 1.79 \"Project X\"]] in the [[wt:en/news/5698-marathon-good-old-s-u-m-m-e-r-en|\"Good Old S.U.M.M.E.R\"]] event of 2018.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->\n\n'''Armour type:'''\n\n* Rolled homogeneous armour (hull, turret, gun shield, gun mantlet)\n* Structural steel (tires, suspension, mudguards)\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Armour !! Front (Slope angle) !! Sides !! Rear !! Roof\n|-\n| Hull || 30 mm (40°) ''Front plate'' <br> 15 mm (70°) ''Front glacis - upper section'' <br> 30 mm (55°) ''Front glacis - lower section'' <br> 30 mm (35°) ''Lower glacis'' || 8 mm (35°) + 4 mm ''Top + Mudguards'' <br> 8 mm (19°) ''Bottom'' || 10 mm (38°) ''Plate connecting with the turret'' <br> 10 mm (21°) ''Engine compartment - upper part'' <br> 10 mm (46°) + 10 mm ''Engine compartment - lower part + add-on spare tire'' || 5 mm\n|-\n| Turret || 14.5 mm (34°) <br> 14.5 mm ''Gun mantlet'' || 14.5 mm || 10 mm (33°) || N/A\n|-\n|}\n'''Notes:'''\n\n* Tires and suspension bars are 10 mm thick.\n* Bottom of the hull is 8 mm thick. An additional 13 mm plate separates the crew compartment from the bottom plate.\n* Viewports for the crew are 30 mm thick.\n\nWhen dealing with the {{PAGENAME}}, the best way to deal with this tank is to catch it out of position and/or from behind. Because of its low armour values, it can be easily destroyed with 12.7 mm MG fire or HE shells to the open roof. Most AP and APHE shots will simply over-penetrate the vehicle's front armour and will not do much to the crew compartment unless aimed at specific crew locations. As such, explosive ammunition or machine gun fire are the more preferred methods of elimination.\n\n=== Mobility ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}\n<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->\n\n{{tankMobility|abMinHp=298|rbMinHp=186}}\n\nThe {{PAGENAME}} accelerates quickly and has a very high cruise speed on hard surfaces (solid ground, roads). While its high speed is an advantage, it can turn into a disadvantage when manoeuvring at high speed: the {{PAGENAME}} starts wobbling if you turn too violently and you end up skidding uncontrollably. Be aware of this before gunning towards the frontline: limit your maximum speed and anticipate the braking phases. Like all WW2 wheeled vehicles, you can not turn on the spot and always need space to change direction. However, thanks to the orientable front and rear axles, your turn radius remains small at small speed. But remember that the faster you drive, the bigger the turn radius will be. Changing directions in a cramped street can be difficult with the {{PAGENAME}}. However, the reverse speed is very important, which mitigates the impossibility to change direction on the spot. As it is equipped with tires, the {{PAGENAME}} struggles on soft terrain (sand, mud, snow). The {{PAGENAME}} is also average at fording: 15 km/h and it loses quickly speed when driving uphill. Obstacles will also make you lose a lot of speed: avoid them as the {{PAGENAME}}'s survival relies on its mobility.\n\n=== Modifications and economy ===\n{{Specs-Economy}}\n\n== Armaments ==\n{{Specs-Tank-Armaments}}\n=== Main armament ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Weapon|1}}\n<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun.

The short 75 mm gun and the 234 chassis work amazingly well within its battle rating. The best way to play this Rank I Goliath is to use your speed and to try to get side and rear shots on the enemy but since you have HEAT at your disposal, you are almost guaranteed to obliterate anything frontally at your battle rating and vice versa. The 234/3 has the same weaknesses as the 234/2 which means it can be and will be torn up by 12.7 mm machine gun fire, assume the position has been spotted after firing and move out via reverse. Engaging in a head-on is unadvised but you can come out kicking should you find yourself against any higher tanks as you should be able to reload fast enough, though this is not a go-to option.\n\nThe 75 mm gun is the same as early Panzer IV and can destroy any other vehicles at and above its battle rating with one hit, meanwhile, the 234/3 has a great speed of 50-60 km/h forwards and backwards to relocate. Because of this, it is possible (though not necessarily needed) to use the 75 mm and return fire while making haste. Terrain foliage such as bushes are great assets for concealment, shadows as well so use them and stay hidden.\n\nLike its older brother, it is recommended to follow the exact same tactics, those being:\n\n# Get behind great cover, either hard cover or visual cover (so rocks and or bushes are great)\n# Use your cover for great visibility (for you to view the enemy)\n# The ability to get deadly hits into the enemies\n\nIn its battle rating of 1.7, the 234/3 will face anything and everything between 1.0 and 2.7, It can and will be destroyed by anything and everything here. But keep in mind that tanks can use Artillery and Air-Spawns to take you down if they can't directly see you, so get under a roof and/or likewise cover where they can't see you nor hit you.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness.

The Germans especially valued the armoured cars due to their speed, firepower, and their pre-war build-up as they were not restricted by the Versailles Treaty. The Germans started with armoured cars like the Sd.Kfz.231 family, each with different armaments. However, these vehicles had its flaws and in August 1940, Germany sought a replacement following the conclusion of the Battle of France.\n\nThe new vehicle was built off an improved Sd.Kfz.232 chassis made in monocoque construction by Büssing-NAG, its armoured body was made by Deutsche Edelstahlwerke, the turret by Daimler-Benz and Schichau, and air-cooled diesel engines by Ringhoffer-Tatra-Werke AG. The monocoque chassis design was built with an eight-wheel steering system, six forward and reverse gears, as well as having an additional driver seat in the rear for quick reversal get-aways. This construction led to '''Sd.Kfz.234''' family. Vehicle construction first started in 1943 as the [[Sd.Kfz.234/2|Sd.Kfz.234/2]], which had a turret originally intended for the VK 1602 Leopard mounting a [[KwK39 (50 mm)|5 cm L/60]] gun, construction continued on this vehicle until mid-1944. The Sd.Kfz.234/2 earned the nickname \"Puma\" from the soldiers using it.\n\nProduction for Sd.Kfz.234/2 shifted towards other armaments in 1944 that replaced the original. This produced variants such as the [[Sd.Kfz.234/1]] which replaced the turret with an open-top one carrying a [[KwK38 (20 mm)|2 cm KwK38]], this was produced between mid-1944 to early 1945. Right besides that, the Sd.Kfz.234/3 was produced with an open-top structure to mount a [[KwK37 (75 mm)|75 mm howitzer]], this was produced from mid-1944 until the end of 1944. At the Sd.Kfz.234/3's production end, it was replaced by the [[Sd.Kfz.234/4]], also known as the \"Pakwagen\", that had the armament replaced by a [[KwK40 (75 mm)|7.5 cm PaK40]] anti-tank gun. This last variant was produced from the end of 1944 to the capitulation of Germany in World War II. A total of 478 Sd.Kfz.234 armoured cars were produced, 200 of the 234/1, 101 of the 234/2, 88 of the 234/3, and 89 of the 234/4.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=germ_sdkfz_234_3 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|h_Gng-eiEXE|'''The Shooting Range #113''' - ''War Machines'' section at 10:49 discusses the {{PAGENAME}}.|QRLKBxSNyGk|'''{{PAGENAME}} Tank Review''' - ''NUSensei''|YtJrPmBOdOI|'''Sd.Kfz.234/3: Rapid HEAT Dispenser''' - ''Napalmratte''}}\n\n== See also ==\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wikipedia:Sd.Kfz._234|[Wikipedia] Sd.Kfz. 234]]\n* [https://tanks-encyclopedia.com/ww2/nazi_germany/Sd-Kfz-234_Puma.php <nowiki>[Tanks Encyclopedia]</nowiki> Sd.Kfz.234 Puma]\n\n{{Germany tank destroyers}}\n{{Germany premium ground vehicles}}\n[[Category:Wheeled ground vehicles]]"}}
