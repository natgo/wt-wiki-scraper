In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' (full name: ''Schwerer Panzerspähwagen 7.5 cm Sonderkraftfahrzeug 234/4 Panzerabwehrkanonenwagen'') is a premium gift rank {{Specs|rank}} German tank destroyer {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced during [[Update 1.69 \"Regia Aeronautica\"]] in the [[Operation_S.U.M.M.E.R.|\"Operation S.U.M.M.E.R.\"]] event of 2017 that lasted from 28 July to 28 August, unlocked after obtaining 7 tanker Marks of Distinction.\n\nThe Sd.Kfz.234/4 is easily picked out by its long gun and gun shield. If recognized, the enemies will see the vehicle as an easy target (in high BR's), but also as a deadly priority target!\n\nThis armoured car is a lot of fun to play. The long 75 mm gun and the 234 chassis work very well hand in hand. The best way to play this mini-beast is to get on the enemies flanks as fast as possible (terrain permitting) and hide in the bushes. Take shots with hit probabilities, but hold fire more uncertain hit chances. Remember that the 234/4 can be and will be torn up by 12.7 mm machine gun fire, assume the position has been spotted after firing and move out via reverse. Do not engage in a straight-up gun battle or the 234/4 becomes scrap metal.\n\nThe 75 mm gun is strong enough to destroy most tanks with one hit, meanwhile the 234/4 has a great speed of 30-40 km/h forwards and backwards to relocate. Because of this, it is possible (though not necessarily needed) to use the 75 mm and return fire while making haste. Terrain foliage such as bushes are great assets for concealment, shadows as well so use them and stay hidden.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->\n'''Armour type:'''\n\n* Rolled homogeneous armour\n* Cast homogeneous armour (Gun mantlet, Vision ports)\n* Structural steel (Side skirts)\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Because of its low armour values, it can be easily penetrated with 12.7 mm MG fire or HE shells to the open roof. Most armour-piercing shots will simply over-penetrate the vehicle's front armour and will not do much to the crew compartment unless aimed at specific crew or module locations. As such, explosive ammunition is the preferred methods of elimination (overpressure).\n\n=== Mobility ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}\n''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle.

The Germans especially valued the armoured cars due to their speed, firepower, and their pre-war build-up as they were not restricted by the Versailles Treaty. The Germans started with armoured cars like the Sd.Kfz.231 family, each with different armaments. However, these vehicles had its flaws and in August 1940, Germany sought a replacement following the conclusion of the Battle of France.\n\nThe new vehicle was built off an improved Sd.Kfz.232 chassis made in monocoque construction by Büssing-NAG, its armoured body was made by Deutsche Edelstahlwerke, the turret by Daimler-Benz and Schichau, and air-cooled diesel engines by Ringhoffer-Tatra-Werke AG. The monocoque chassis design was built with an eight-wheel steering system, six forward and reverse gears, as well as having an additional driver seat in the rear for quick reversal get-aways. This construction led to '''Sd.Kfz.234''' family. Vehicle construction first started in 1943 as the [[Sd.Kfz.234/2|Sd.Kfz.234/2]], which had a turret originally intended for the VK 1602 Leopard mounting a [[KwK 39 (50 mm)|5 cm L/60]] gun, construction continued on this vehicle until mid-1944. The Sd.Kfz.234/2 earned the nickname \"Puma\" from the soldiers using it.\n\nProduction for Sd.Kfz.234/2 shifted towards other armaments in 1944 that replaced the original. This produced variants such as the Sd.Kfz.234/1 which replaced the turret with an open-top one carrying a [[KwK 30 (20 mm)|2 cm KwK 38]], this was produced between mid-1944 to early 1945. Right besides that, the Sd.Kfz.234/3 was produced with an open-top structure to mount a [[KwK 37 (75 mm)|75 mm howitzer]], this was produced from mid-1944 until the end of 1944. At the Sd.Kfz.234/3's production end, it was replaced by the [[Sd.Kfz.234/4|Sd.Kfz.234/4]], also known as the \"Pakwagen\", that had the armament replaced by a [[KwK 40 (75 mm)|7.5 cm PaK 40]] anti-tank gun. This last variant was produced from the end of 1944 to the capitulation of Germany in World War II. A total of 478 Sd.Kfz.234 armoured cars were produced, 200 of the 234/1, 101 of the 234/2, 88 of the 234/3, and 89 of the 234/4.\n\n===Combat usage===\nThe Sd.Kfz.234 cars were originally intended for the conflicts in North Africa. However, the engine development took abnormally long to complete and by the time it was ready, the North African theatre had concluded. Nevertheless, they served in the Western and Eastern front with success, but was impeded by its low production count.\n\nThe Sd.Kfz.234/2 variant was arguably the most popular, as the staple of the 234 family. The vehicle served in the Panzer Lehr Division, 1st and 2nd SS Panzer Division, 2nd, 7th, 13th, and 20th Panzer Division. The Sd.Kfz.234 in the recon companies were allocated in 19 or 25 vehicles per division, further split into platoons up to six vehicles and one as the headquarters. However, due to their low production numbers, this allocation was rarely kept in full strength in the war,\n\nThe Sd.Kfz.234 first saw combat in Normandy after D-Day in the stationed Panzer Lehr and 2nd Panzer Division in the Sd.Kfz.234/2 variant. The divisions used these vehicles in recon roles until their withdrawal behind the Seine River, with Panzer Lehr having 8 Sd.Kfz.234/2 of the original 26 it had. These divisions were rebuilt in the fall of 1944 with the Sd.Kfz.234/1 and Sd.Kfz.234/3 after the 234/2 ceased production.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=germ_sdkfz_234_4 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|b7EikSPup3Q|'''The Shooting Range #58''' - ''Metal Beasts'' section at 08:00 discusses the {{PAGENAME}}.|RGeu2yLGeTU|'''Best armored cars''' discusses the {{PAGENAME}} at 4:37 - ''War Thunder Official Channel''}}\n\n== See also ==\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wt:en/news/4862/current|[Devblog] Sd.Kfz.234/4 Schwerer Panzerspähwagen]]\n\n{{Germany tank destroyers}}\n{{Germany premium ground vehicles}}\n[[Category:Wheeled ground vehicles]]"}}
