For these reasons, the Sd.Kfz.251/10 should not be used in the frontlines due to being so lightly armored even against 7.62 mm machine gun fire can and will harm you. \n\n''As a sniper:''\n\nDue to its gun's high muzzle velocity, the {{PAGENAME}} is more than capable of having a sniper combat role in long range maps. It should be noted that the main gun sights have really low zoom (though normal for the BR it sits at), meaning it is not capable of achieving shots at extreme ranges but will dominate the long range engagements like many German high velocity guns.\n\n''As a support vehicle:''\n\nThis is the most reliable role the Sd.Kfz.251/10 can play as, especially since not every map the player will have the sniping distances needed (Sweden or Berlin for example). It should be performing support fire from behind the most armored vehicles at the BR (Pz.III for example) and utilize its quick firing gun to disable or destroy enemy tanks. It should be noted that machine gun fire is your worst enemy as:\n\na) the crew is exposed\n\nb) it is an open top vehicle\n\nc) has little to no armor which can barely stop 7.62 mm at point blank ranges, 12.7 mm (.50 cal) will completely destroy it if strafed with\n\nDue to being a halftrack, the {{PAGENAME}} has superb traction and decent speed compared to fully wheeled vehicles. It is able to move through rough terrain easier than fully wheeled vehicles (snow, sand, mud, etc.) but still somewhat maintain its speed as a wheeled vehicle in urban terrain such as roads, although it will be definitely slower compared to fully wheeled vehicles.\n\n{{Notice|As a half track, the {{PAGENAME}} shares tank track traction but does not share tank steering. The front wheels have to turn like a normal car.}}\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics.

As such, the vehicle was intended to taxi troops into battle and protect them from small arms fire and shrapnel. By the end of the war, over 15,000 units of the Sd.Kfz.251 were built.\n\nHowever, platoon leader vehicles received a special upgrade to their firepower in order to increase the effectiveness of fire support provided for advancing infantry. Namely, the standard machine gun mount was replaced by a turret housing a 3.7cm PaK anti-tank cannon. These versions, designated Sd.Kfz. 251/10, served with the Wehrmacht until 1944, by which time over 300 units were built.\n\n''- From [[wt:en/news/6871-development-crafting-event-strategist-sd-kfz-251-10-en|Devblog]]''\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=germ_sdkfz_251_10 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Images\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" caption=\"Sd.Kfz. 251/10 Devblog Images\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Sd.Kfz. 251-10 WTWallpaper 001.jpg|\nFile:Sd.Kfz. 251-10 WTWallpaper 002.jpg|\nFile:Sd.Kfz. 251-10 WTWallpaper 003.jpg|\nFile:Sd.Kfz. 251-10 WTWallpaper 004.jpg|\nFile:Sd.Kfz. 251-10 WTWallpaper 005.jpg|\nFile:Sd.Kfz. 251-10 WTWallpaper 006.jpg|\n</gallery>\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|LrohrJ_R5oE|'''The {{PAGENAME}} Tank Destroyer''' - ''Orangefan''|wrWvXzvPfv0|'''{{PAGENAME}}, Worth the Grind? - Wargame \"Strategist\"''' - ''ConeOfArc''}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n;Other German half-tracks\n\n* [[Sd.Kfz. 6/2]]\n* [[15 cm Pz.W.42]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wt:news/6871-development-crafting-event-strategist-sd-kfz-251-10-en|[Devblog] Crafting event \"Strategist\": Sd.Kfz.251/10]]\n* [[wikipedia:Sd.Kfz._251|[Wikipedia] Sd.Kfz. 251]]\n* [https://tanks-encyclopedia.com/ww2/nazi_germany/sdkfz-251_hanomag.php <nowiki>[Tanks Encyclopedia]</nowiki> Sd.Kfz.251]\n\n{{TankManufacturer Hanomag}}\n{{Germany tank destroyers}}\n{{Germany premium ground vehicles}}\n\n[[Category:Half-tracks]]"}}
