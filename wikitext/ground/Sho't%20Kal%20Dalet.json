In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium rank {{Specs|rank}} Israeli medium tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update \"Danger Zone\"]].\n\nOriginally introduced in the [[Sho't Kal Dalet (Great Britain)|British tech tree]], the {{PAGENAME}} was moved into the Israeli tech tree. It closely resembles the standard tech tree variant [[Sho't Kal Gimel]] with differences mostly in cosmetics, with the {{PAGENAME}} appearing in a default desert tan camouflage and a spare road wheel hanging in front.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->\nAs a Centurion-based tank, the {{PAGENAME}} comes under increasingly lethal enemy shells, APFSDS and HEAT-FS, that can easily penetrate the front of the tank. Some attempts can be seen to remedy this issue, with an extra 51 mm plate welded on top of the base 76.2 mm hull front armour, and ERA platings to help protect against HEAT-FS. Both of these can help resist against the glancing kinetic or chemical shells and hopefully provide extra breathing room for the {{PAGENAME}} to continue manoeuvring on the battlefield.\n\nSide armour, without any up-armouring effort, proves to be vulnerable against autocannon rounds from IFVs or SPAAs, so it is best to keep the tank's frontal array pointed towards the main threat. Any penetration on the tank, whether from the front or the sides, have a very high chance of hitting one of the crew, the ammunition, or the fuel. Combined with the relatively dubious reliability of the front armour, a {{PAGENAME}} would benefit from a very safe playstyle reducing the number of chances the {{PAGENAME}} can be hit in.\n\nFront-launching smoke grenades are also available with the tank, allowing the players the option to quickly bring up concealment in order to withdraw the {{PAGENAME}} to a safe place if under threat of enemy fire.\n\n'''Armour type:'''\n\n*Rolled homogeneous armour (Hull, Roof, Turret roof, Cupola roof, Side skirts, Smoke launchers)\n*Cast homogeneous armour (Turret, Gun mantlet, Cupola sides)\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->\nCompared to the tech tree [[Sho't Kal Alef]] and [[Sho't Kal Gimel]], the {{PAGENAME}} has very similar mobility due to sharing the same engine upgrade into a 750 hp Continental diesel engine with 2,400 RPM. Forward speeds can reach up to 48 km/h (5 gears) in RB. Reverse speed, great already in the basic Centurion, is enhanced by this engine upgrade to reach up to -12 km/h (2 gears) to aid in the tank's withdrawal efforts.\n\n{{tankMobility|abMinHp=1,162|rbMinHp=663}}\n\n=== Modifications and economy ===\n{{Specs-Economy}}\n\n== Armaments ==\n{{Specs-Tank-Armaments}}\n=== Main armament ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Weapon|1}}\n<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun.

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\nAs mentioned in previous sections, the {{PAGENAME}} is rather poorly protected against straight-on kinetic hits, but its cannon is quite lethal with the available ammunition and rate of fire. As such, the {{PAGENAME}} should be used moreso as a \"sniper\", staying farther range and using the Sharir cannon and the M111 APFSDS round to engage enemies from afar.\n\nThis playstyle is benefited from the laser rangefinder available to the {{PAGENAME}}, which can provide accurate, and compensated, ranges for the cannon to fire at the enemy quickly. When firing from so far, the only enemy threats would be tanks with similar fire control systems for long-range fighting or missile launchers. In the latter case, the presence of ERA plates on the {{PAGENAME}} may prove key to its survival by protecting the tank against a single hit, which then allows {{PAGENAME}} players to assess where the missile came from and either withdraw into cover or engage the missile launcher if it has been spotted.\n\nFighting in a hull-down position would also benefit the {{PAGENAME}} to reduce its profile to the turret, which has a more complex armour design as well as more ERA coverage from the front.\n\nWhile close-range fighting is not impossible with the {{PAGENAME}} with its stabilized gun and mobility, the weak side armour and relatively slow turret and hull traverse makes the vehicle not ideal to that playstyle.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness.

Deliveries continued well into the 1960s, with Israel fielding more than 300 Centurion tanks prior to the Six-Day War in 1967.\n\nAlthough the Centurion, or Sho't as it was called by the Israelis, was the most modern tank in service with the IDF at the time, it wasn't very liked among Israeli tank crews due to its low reliability in desert conditions. Therefore, the decision was made to modernize the vehicles in May 1967 by replacing the petrol engine with a more powerful and reliable Continental diesel engine. Further upgrades included the fitting of a new transmission, larger fuel tanks and other minor improvements.\n\nIn the following Middle Eastern conflicts of the late '60s and early '70s, the Sho't had proven its effectiveness in combat. However, after the devastating tank losses of the Yom Kippur War, Israeli engineers realized the importance of crew protection and work on an indigenous tank design, that would become the Merkava, began.\n\nIn the meantime, the vehicles that were already in service had to be modernized in order to prevent a repeat of the high losses of the Yom Kippur War in potential future conflicts. This modernization effort primarily focused on the addition of the Blazer ERA package to the Sho't Kal and Magach tanks, which would reduce the effectiveness of chemical munitions fired at the vehicles.\n\nThe upgraded Sho't Kal Dalet, as it was known, proved the effectiveness of the upgrade during the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982, where it fared well against ATGMs and RPGs.\n\nThe Sho't Kal Dalet was the last mass-produced modification of the Israeli Centurion, before it was replaced by the more modern Merkava tank models. In total, Israel had purchased and used over 1,100 Centurion tanks, with some still being in limited service today as APCs, ARVs or CEVs.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n;Skins\n\n*[https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=il_centurion_shot_kal_d Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n;''Vehicles equipped with the same chassis''\n\n*[[Sho't (Family)]]\n*[[Centurion (Family)]]\n\n;''Other vehicles of similar configuration and role''\n\n*[[Sho't Kal Gimel]]\n*[[Centurion Mk.5/1]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n* [[wt:en/news/5912-development-sho-t-kal-dalet-conquering-the-desert-en|[Devblog] Sho't Kal Dalet: Conquering the Desert]]\n* [[wikipedia:Sho't#Sho't_Kal_Alef/Bet/Gimel/Dalet|[Wikipedia] Sho't Kal Dalet]]\n* [https://tanks-encyclopedia.com/modern/Israel/Shot-MBT.php <nowiki>[Tanks Encyclopedia]</nowiki> Sho't MBT]\n\n{{TankManufacturer Israeli Ordnance Corps}}\n{{Israel medium tanks}}\n{{Israel premium ground vehicles}}"}}
