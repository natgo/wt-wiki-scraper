In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Israeli medium tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update \"Wind of Change\"]].\n\nA modernization of the Israeli fleet of Centurion tanks using NATO equipment, including a new 105 mm cannon, Continental engine, and ERA packs: the Sho't Kal Gimel shares similar capabilities to previous Sho't Kal series tanks with better chemical protection.\n\nThe name \"Sho't Kal Gimel\" can be roughly translated as Centurion tank with Continental engine (Kal) Model C (Gimel is the 3rd letter of the Hebrew alphabet). \"Sho't\" is the codename for Israeli Centurion tanks and literally means \"Whip\".\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->\nThe overall appearance of the Sho't Kal Gimel is very similar to its predecessor, the Alef; but in view of the intensity of the Middle Eastern Wars, the Gimel installed the Blazer ERA covering its front and some parts of its sides, as well as an extra layer of armour plate welded on the UFP, increasing its odds to survive a hit. The IDF also installed additional machine guns, so players can tell it's a Sho't Kal Gimel right away. Although the installation of ERA helped improved its odds against HEAT shells, but later missiles or kinetic shells will easily penetrate the obsolete base armour all-around.\n\n'''Armour type:'''\n\n* Rolled homogeneous armour (Hull, turret roof)\n* Cast homogeneous armour (Turret, gun mantlet)\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->\n\n{{tankMobility|abMinHp=1,162|rbMinHp=663}}\n\nThe overall mobility, thanks to the new Continental AVDS-1790-2A diesel engine and Allison CD-850-6A transmission, has vastly improved from original Centurions (48 km/h vs 35 km/h forward) and oddly enough, Gimel is lighter than Alef, meaning the overall mobility is better. While it is nowhere close to Soviet or later NATO tanks in terms of power-weight ratio, it is still sufficient to keep up with the rest of the team.\n\n=== Modifications and economy ===\n{{Specs-Economy}}\n\n== Armaments ==\n{{Specs-Tank-Armaments}}\n=== Main armament ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Weapon|1}}\n<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun.

Give advice on how to use them and how to fill the ammunition storage.'' -->\n{{main|Sharir (105 mm)}}\n\nThe main gun \"Sharir\" (lit. \"Strong\") is identical to NATO's L7 105 mm guns in many aspects. In particular, the Gimel has access to APFSDS round that further enhance its odds to penetrate enemies.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"100%\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" | [[Sharir (105 mm)|105 mm Sharir]] || colspan=\"5\" | Turret rotation speed (°/s) || colspan=\"4\" | Reloading rate (seconds)\n|-\n!

It is still sufficient to knock out lighter vehicles with overpressure damage.\n\nM156 shell, aka L35, is identical to other 105 mm HESH rounds, having high explosive content to knock out vehicles right away with overpressure while the overall performance of the shell is mixed, not to mention its slow and high-arcing ballistics; so either take this shell for detonating lighter vehicles or sniping stationary targets that expose their vulnerable spots. A solid hit is very likely to send enemies straight back to the hanger.\n\nM111 APFSDS, aka DM23, is found on some other NATO vehicles and they perform identically. Being a long-rod dart, this shell can safely penetrate most tanks it might face at the rank. This will be the go-to round for the tank.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"100%\"\n! colspan=\"8\" | Penetration statistics\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" data-sort-type=\"text\" | Ammunition\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Type of<br>warhead\n! colspan=\"6\" | Penetration @ 0° Angle of Attack (mm)\n|-\n! 10 m !! 100 m !! 500 m !! 1,000 m !! 1,500 m !! 2,000 m\n|-\n| M152 || HEATFS || 400 || 400 || 400 || 400 || 400 || 400\n|-\n| M156 || HESH || 127 || 127 || 127 || 127 || 127 || 127\n|-\n| M111 || APFSDS || 337 || 335 || 330 || 322 || 314 || 306\n|-\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"100%\"\n! colspan=\"10\" | Shell details\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" data-sort-type=\"text\" | Ammunition\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Type of<br>warhead\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Velocity<br>(m/s)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Projectile<br>Mass (kg)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Fuse delay<br>(m)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Fuse sensitivity<br>(mm)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Explosive Mass<br>(TNT equivalent) (g)\n! colspan=\"3\" | Ricochet\n|-\n! 0% !! 50% !! 100%\n|-\n| M152 || HEATFS || 1,173 || 10.5 || 0.05 || 0.1 || 1,270 || 65° || 72° || 77°\n|-\n| M156 || HESH || 732 || 14.85 || 0.1 || 4 || 4,310 || 73° || 77° || 80°\n|-\n| M111 || APFSDS || 1,455 || 3.79 || N/A || N/A || N/A || 78° || 80° || 81°\n|-\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n! colspan=\"7\" | Smoke shell characteristics\n|-\n!

Gimel has an extra layer of armour on its UFP as well as Blazer ERA on some areas of the tank; while this can help it survive full-calibre and HEAT shells, it will not survive any late Cold War-era missiles or most APFSDS. The cramped interior also means any penetrating shots will cause extensive damage to the crew and compartment. Thus, it is best to stay away from heated battlefields and never rush in Sho't Kal Gimel (its inferior speed also helps to limit this).\n\nHowever, this tank does still have some advantages: it has access to APFSDS, although not having the highest penetration at its rank, it is sufficient to tear through enemy armour from a distance. It might not have the best gun optics or handling due to the obsolete nature of Centurion chassis, but it can still serve its purpose if used with caution.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness.
