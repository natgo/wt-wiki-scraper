In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' (lit. \"Whip\") is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Israeli medium tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update \"Wind of Change\"]].\n\nThe representation of the early fleet of Israeli Centurions bought from various operators, the Sho't performs identically to its British counterpart [[Centurion Mk.5/1]], having good gun handling at its rank while suffering from somewhat insufficient protection and low mobility.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->\nPlayers can tell the Sho't in-game as a Centurion Mk.5 right away as the bore evacuator is unique to later variants of Centurion (QF 20 pdr Model B), as well as the additional pintle-mounted M2HB machine gun, though it lacks the headlights found on the Australian variant. The overall protection is totally identical to pre-Mk 10 Centurion variants, which also means that it has the same cramped interior and any penetrating shots can knock out the Sho't right away.\n\n'''Armour type:''' <!-- The types of armour present on the vehicle and their general locations -->\n<!-- Example: * Rolled homogeneous armour (Front, Side, Rear, Hull roof)\n* Cast homogeneous armour (Turret, Transmission area) -->\n* Rolled homogeneous armour (Hull, Turret roof)\n* Cast homogeneous armour (Turret)\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->\n\n{{tankMobility|abMinHp=1,007|rbMinHp=575}}\n\nSince the Sho't was directly imported from various sources, it shares identical mobility and its Rolls-Royce Meteor engine; players of British or Sweden Centurions will find themselves at home right away. This also means that the overall mobility is inferior just like most unmodified Centurions.\n\n=== Modifications and economy ===\n{{Specs-Economy}}\n\n== Armaments ==\n{{Specs-Tank-Armaments}}\n=== Main armament ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Weapon|1}}\n<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun.

Additionally, it doesn't have any explosive filler, so players will need to aim for weakspots or ammo racks to achieve the most devastating damage.\n\nThe second stock shell, Shell Mk.1 HE, is practically useless against any armoured targets and not even enough to trigger overpressure damage. While it is still enough to blast exposed crews, it is suggested to ignore this shell.\n\nShot Mk.3 APDS is another story: its flat trajectory and high velocity helps it in hitting long-distance targets or fast movers. However, the overall post-effect is still quite disappointing, so players have to remember the weakspots or ammo racks just like with the Shot Mk.1.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"100%\"\n! colspan=\"8\" | Penetration statistics\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" data-sort-type=\"text\" | Ammunition\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Type of<br>warhead\n! colspan=\"6\" | Penetration @ 0° Angle of Attack (mm)\n|-\n! 10 m !! 100 m !! 500 m !! 1,000 m !! 1,500 m !! 2,000 m\n|-\n| Shot Mk.1 || APCBC || 232 || 229 || 216 || 201 || 187 || 173\n|-\n| Shot Mk.3 || APDS || 285 || 283 || 262 || 239 || 218 || 198\n|-\n| Shell Mk.1 || HE || 15 || 15 || 15 || 15 || 15 || 15\n|-\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"100%\"\n! colspan=\"10\" | Shell details\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" data-sort-type=\"text\" | Ammunition\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Type of<br>warhead\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Velocity<br>(m/s)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Projectile<br>Mass (kg)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Fuse delay<br>(m)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Fuse sensitivity<br>(mm)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Explosive Mass<br>(TNT equivalent) (g)\n! colspan=\"3\" | Ricochet\n|-\n! 0% !! 50% !! 100%\n|-\n| Shot Mk.1 || APCBC || 1,000 || 9.1 || N/A || N/A || N/A || 48° || 63° || 71°\n|-\n| Shot Mk.3 || APDS || 1,430 || 3.2 || N/A || N/A || N/A || 75° || 78° || 80°\n|-\n| Shell Mk.1 || HE || 600 || 7.5 || 0 || 0.1 || 1,130 || 79° || 80° || 81°\n|-\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n! colspan=\"7\" | Smoke shell characteristics\n|-\n!

They total 8 shells and get filled first when loading up the tank.\n** These racks are also emptied early: the depletion order at full capacity is 8 - 9 - 1 - 2 - etc. until 7.\n** Full reload speed will be realized as long as shells are available in the ready racks 8 and 9.  If the ready racks are empty, a penalty to reload speed will occur.\n** Simply not firing when the gun is loaded will move ammo from racks 1-7 into racks 9 then 8. Firing will interrupt the restocking of the ready racks.\n\n=== Machine guns ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Weapon|2}}\n{{Specs-Tank-Weapon|3}}\n<!-- ''Offensive and anti-aircraft machine guns not only allow you to fight some aircraft but also are effective against lightly armoured vehicles.

Refrain from creating a \"guide\" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\nLike other Centurions, thanks to the underpowered engine, Sho't is not a fast tank by any means and its 35 km/h top speed makes it lag behind some tanks at its rank, not to mention fast movers like Leopard 1. However, this also means that the Sho't can stay close with friendly heavy tanks (which are still common at the battle rating) and provide reliable fire support for them even on the move thanks to its gun stabilizer. Although the overall protection is not sufficient to withstand shots from enemies, the gun depression angle certainly helps to find hull-down positions and use the gun mantlet to absorb or bounce incoming shells. While some players prefer the high penetration of APDS, some might opt to use the stock APCBC for better spalling; but in most cases where the enemy has thick armour, APDS will be the go-to shell for Sho't.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics.
