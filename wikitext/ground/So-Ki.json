In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Japanese self-propelled anti-aircraft gun {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced along with the initial Japanese Ground Forces tree in [[Update 1.65 \"Way of the Samurai\"]].\n\nThis anti-aircraft vehicle features dual [[Type 98 (20 mm)|20 mm Type 98]] cannons which have high velocity rounds and good traverse. The tank is quite fast, being built off the chassis of the Type 98 [[Ke-Ni]]. Players can use it as a scout by shooting other tanks and marking them on the map, but the primary role of the design is defending the team against aircraft. This tank performs decently at its BR and with a good commander, it can be competitive against aircraft even into higher tiers.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->\nDue to the thin armour and open turret, many vehicles can destroy the So-Ki. Enemies armed with a 12.7 mm HMG and other large-calibre anti-aircraft guns and aircraft cannons are particularly deadly as they can pierce through the hull and gunshield without much issue. \n\nIn destroying this tank, a shot slightly to the right of the driver's hatch can knock out both crew members in the hull at the same time. In Ground RB, this will result in an instant knock out. If only one crew member is knocked out, coaxial machine guns can be used to fire at the half-open turret. If the vehicle is hull-down or in a position that the hull cannot be hit, it is recommended to incapacitate the gunner, wait for him to be replaced, and then knock out the replacement. \n\nFortunately for the So-Ki, the light hull allows the vehicle to go pretty fast. There are some instances where you can literally outrun shells fired by enemies who are shooting at a fair distance away.\n\n'''Armour type:'''\n\n* Rolled homogeneous armour\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

You can be a scout and mark enemies so they appear on the map - but it is recommended to only do this if you have a clear way to escape and aren't in danger of counter-fire.\n\n=== Modifications and economy ===\n{{Specs-Economy}}\n\n== Armaments ==\n{{Specs-Tank-Armaments}}\n=== Main armament ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Weapon|1}}\n<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun.

That being said, it is highly recommended to always pay attention to what's going on in the air. The So-Ki's gunner can get knocked out quickly, so being aware of the battle in the air, as well as on the ground is essential.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"100%\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"6\" | [[Type 98 (20 mm)|20 mm Type 98]] (x2) || colspan=\"5\" | Turret rotation speed (°/s) || colspan=\"4\" | Reloading rate (seconds)\n|-\n!

For the most part the So-Ki should fit its purpose in the AA role, rather than an AT one. The sound of aircraft engines will let the player know if potential enemies (and targets) are coming.\n\nAt its battle rating, the So-Ki can penetrate the sides of some tanks like the [[M4|M4 Sherman]], [[Strv m/42 EH]], [[Pz.IV F2]] and [[Pz.III L]], but this is usually only possible at close range. This tank can deal with many lightly armoured targets like other [[:Category:Anti-aircraft vehicles|SPAAs]] and some [[:Category:Light tanks|Light Tanks]] so if the situation requires, the So-Ki can take the role. \n\nAs for an AA role, this vehicle's performance is competent. It can shoot down low-flying aircraft with relative ease, and anyone who knows how to properly lead targets can easily shoot down most aircraft this tank will meet.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness.

Driver and Loader can be knocked out in one shot\n* Vulnerable to incoming artillery rounds and aerial strafing/bombing\n* Rapid-firing quickly depletes medium-capacity ammunition magazines\n\n== History ==\n<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction.

This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->\nPrior to World War II, Japan experimented with developing anti-aircraft guns based on several different platforms, including trucks, tanks and railroad cars. Production ended up developing an SPAAG that could shoot down aircraft at low altitudes. The Japanese military, however, wanted their SPAAGs to have the capability to also shoot down aircraft at medium altitudes too. Alongside the range requirements, the vehicle needed to be highly mobile to provide adequate protection to convoys from aerial attack.\n\nBy 1941, Japan started prototyping two variations of the new SPAAG. The first prototype was a single-mounted 20 mm Type 98 cannon on a [[Ke-Ni]] hull with a roofless turret known as the \"[[Ta-Se]]\", short for ''Taikū'' (\"anti-air\") ''Sensha'' (\"tank\"). The second prototype was a dual-mount Type 98 on the same hull with an open gun platform.\n\nThe crew positions of the So-Ki featured a driver situated in the centre of the vehicle, right under the anti-aircraft gun emplacement. To aid in protecting the cannon crew (gunner and loaders) a gun shield was added to block or deflect small arms fire. A bench for the crew was mounted at the rear of the platform and could be folded out of the way to allow for placement of more ammunition magazines if necessary.\n\nThe total ammunition capacity for this vehicle was 22 magazines plus two more already loaded in the cannons. The rate of fire for the Type-98 cannons was around 830 rounds per minute, however, velocities between rounds differed due to round type and explosive filler. \n\nUnfortunately for the Imperial Japanese Army, the So-Ki never entered production and by the time it was ready to enter service, the needs of the army in anti-aircraft vehicles had significantly evolved. Engineers were also having a difficult time massing sufficient resources necessary for the mass production of new units because of the increasing Allied progression in the Pacific.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=jp_type_95_so_ki Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|_yh75uwKfV8|So-Ki SPAAG Vehicle Review - ''NuSensei''}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!--''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''-->\n\n;Vehicles equipped with the same chassis\n* [[Ta-Se]]\n* [[Ke-Ni]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wt:en/news/4378-development-so-ki-elusive-twin-guns-en|[Devblog] So-Ki: Elusive Twin Guns]]\n* [http://sensha-manual.blogspot.com/2016/12/wt-so-ki-spaa.html <nowiki>[Sensha] - [WT]</nowiki> So-Ki SPAA]\n\n{{Japan anti-aircraft vehicles}}"}}
