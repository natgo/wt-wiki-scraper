In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium gift rank {{Specs|rank}} French heavy tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update \"Raining Fire\"]] as a [[wt:en/news/6852-news-meet-major-update-raining-fire-en|premium pack]] in the Gaijin store.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->\nThe upper glacis of the hull and the upper part of the turret are the only well-protected areas, which will give you good protection against most conventional rounds, especially from far ranges. However, the rest of the armour is very weak and can be easily penetrated by pretty much everything, and you will still be vulnerable against HEAT-FS, ATGMs, APFSDS and such. Your best bet is to flank the enemy and take them out with your auto-loading gun before they can get a hit on you. If an enemy spots you, face them so they can only hit the front of the tank, and hope that they don't hit the very weak bottom portion of your turret. Try not to angle your tank as the sides can easily be penetrated. Since you have 5 crew members, with 2 in the front of the hull and 3 in the turret, and come equipped with a handy autoloader, you can take a few hits and lose a couple of crew members without having to worry too much.\n\n'''Armour type:'''\n\n* Rolled homogeneous armour (hull, turret roof)\n* Cast homogeneous armour (oscillating turret, turret base, cupola)\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

You will still want to flank the enemy as much as possible and take them out quickly with your auto-loading gun, but don't be afraid to take a few hits from the front. However, your reverse speed is pretty slow and will not save you, so watch out for that.\n\n{{tankMobility|abMinHp=1291|rbMinHp=884}}\n\n=== Modifications and economy ===\n{{Specs-Economy}}\n\n== Armaments ==\n{{Specs-Tank-Armaments}}\n=== Main armament ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Weapon|1}}\n<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun.

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\nTry to play the Somua SM quite aggressively because it has a very strong autoloader. Hardly anyone else on the battlefield owns an autoloader like the French do at this battle rating.\n\nIt's best to find a good, but safe position close to the front to get good shots onto targets. If encountering an enemy tank with good turret armor like a Tiger II, try to shoot the weak spots. Though the gun should be sufficient for front penetration, the {{PAGENAME}} can drive around to hit the target's side armour do to its semi-good mobility. If the enemy tank tries to drive away, shoot it in the tracks to immobilise it.\n\nThough the 4-second autoloader is the {{PAGENAME}}'s greatest asset, try not to fire too quickly as the autoloader can only carry 8 rounds at a time. Refilling the autoloader can take a long time. Once the 8 shots are depleted, look for a safe position behind the terrain or other cover and wait until the autoloader is refilled with shells.\n\nA {{PAGENAME}}'s main worry on the battlefield is its own armour, as while the hull front is somewhat good, everywhere else is easy to penetrate by most tank shells being shot at the {{PAGENAME}}. This is especially the case when encountering tanks with HEAT rounds, as then nowhere on the tank is safe from a penetration. Always make sure that no one shoots the {{PAGENAME}} from the side because the damage can be very serious due to the ammunition stowage.\n\nWhen fighting at the front lines, always try to drive with other tanks so that the {{PAGENAME}} does not get as much focus. Attacking the enemies while they are attacking allies is the best way to catch them off guard with the 100 mm cannon. With its autoloader, the {{PAGENAME}} can be a deadly machine by picking off the enemies one by one before they can react.\n\nPlan carefully your moves as there is no good way to get out of a bad position without having either to expose its weak sides or to reverse at a very slow speed.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics.

Longer, wider, and taller than a Tiger II. Finding proper concealment is difficult\n* The neck of the turret a prime weak spot that's hard to effectively hide\n* The lower plate is as weak as British lower plates. Any APHE shell that enters here will likely knock out the whole crew\n* Will face a lot of enemies that fire APDS and HEAT, the upper turret and upper plate just can't absorb those kinds of shells\n* Terrible side armour, side-scraping or angling the tank is extremely hazardous\n* Is much slower than the Lorraine and AMX-50\n* Mediocre elevation angles thanks to the inherent nature of oscillating turrets\n* Once the autoloader is expended, reloading the magazine takes a considerable amount of time\n* Because of the 4.0s reload, you can quite easily empty the 9 round magazine\n\n== History ==\n<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block \"/History\" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template.

The SOMUA Company competed with AMX to design a new heavy tank for France, and they were given the order to build a prototype in 1946. The hull of the tank was based off the German Tiger II, and the tank used an oscillating turret armed with an auto-loading 100 mm gun. Because the two companies were forced to make a new design with the same requirements, the Somua SM design looked similar to the AMX 50, and both tanks had equipped the 100 mm gun. The prototype was delivered in October of 1951 but was still lacking an engine and some other parts. Due to delays, the prototype was not tested until 1953, but it was already too late. The SOMUA's design was rejected in favour of the AMX 50.\n\n=== [[wt:en/news/6825-development-somua-sm-heavy-weight-fighter-en|Devblog]] ===\nIn 1946, at the same time when AMX was given the order to develop what would eventually become the AMX-50 tank, SOMUA was instructed to come up with a competing design that would act as an alternative to the AMX.\n\nDue to both companies being issued identical technical requirements by the French Army and taking much inspiration from the German \"King Tiger\" at the same time, both designs turned out to be very similar. In fact, SOMUA's design stood out from AMX's only in increased mass, coming as a result of heavier protection, and in its more simple running gear.\n\nThe SOMUA SM, as it became known, was presented for the first time to army officials in October 1951, albeit without its engine installed. At the same time, prototypes of the AMX-50 had already been tested. By 1953, SOMUA had completed the construction of its SM tank, subsequently conducting trials.\n\nDuring testing however, several design issues were revealed. Because of this and the fact that the upgunned version of the AMX-50 with a 120mm gun was already available, the decision was made to cancel further work on the project. As a result, the SOMUA SM never left the prototype stage and the only constructed vehicle was  scrapped shortly after the project's cancellation.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=fr_somua_sm Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Images\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" caption=\"Somua SM Devblog Images\" heights=\"150\">\nFile:Somua SM WTWallpaper 001.jpg|\nFile:Somua SM WTWallpaper 002.jpg|\nFile:Somua SM WTWallpaper 003.jpg|\nFile:Somua SM WTWallpaper 004.jpg|\nFile:Somua SM WTWallpaper 005.jpg|\nFile:Somua SM WTWallpaper 006.jpg|\n</gallery>\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|KSaBs_8yOno|'''Premium Vehicles: Somua SM''' - ''War Thunder Wiki''|cj5yjwMfmAM|'''The Shooting Range #217''' - ''Metal Beasts'' section at 00:30 discusses the {{PAGENAME}}.|vQQSE0uTjnM|'''Should You Buy The {{PAGENAME}}?''' - ''Sako Sniper''|5aOvTs0novk|'''Frenchtastic - {{PAGENAME}} new French Heavy''' - ''Napalmratte''|wXLZaDh0uEQ|'''Should You Buy: {{PAGENAME}}''' - ''ConeOfArc''}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!--''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''-->\n\n* [[AMX-50_Surbaisse|AMX-50 Surbaissé]]\n* [[AMX-50_Surblinde|AMX-50 Surblindé]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wt:en/news/6825-development-somua-sm-heavy-weight-fighter-en|[Devblog] SOMUA SM: Heavy Weight Fighter]]\n\n{{France heavy tanks}}\n{{France premium ground vehicles}}"}}
