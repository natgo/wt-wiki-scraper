In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Swedish light tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.97 \"Viking Fury\"]].\n\nThe {{PAGENAME}} is a Swedish IFV capable of firing modern shells at a devastating rate, effectively dealing with any type of opponent it faces, resulting in a valuable support vehicle.\n\n== General info ==\nCompared to most IFVs found in the game, the {{PAGENAME}} is a lot different to its peers. The tank has no Anti-tank missiles, and sits at the highest ranks, facing vehicles other IFVs never get to experience. This is due to the design of the vehicle, as the {{PAGENAME}} features a reliable 40mm Bofors cannon, which should be familiar to most players. However, this cannon features something unlike any other 40mm. The vehicle fires sub-caliber shells with fin-stabilization, capable of shredding any opponent from the side, even frontally. This compensates for the lack of missiles, and results in a highly versatile vehicle capable of disposing several opponents at once, as it can fire up to 24 shells in the span of 12 seconds.\n\nIf the anti-tank capabilities weren't enough, the cannon features Proximity-fused High-explosive shells, capable of tearing apart any unsuspecting aerial opponent. This feature is incredibly useful in higher tiers, as close-range helicopters and attacking planes are incredibly common. Despite the {{PAGENAME}} lacking any form of radar equipment compared to its SPAA sister, the [[Lvkv 9040C]], the tank can still effectively deal with aerial targets, especially at closer ranges.\n\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->\nThe tank has a decent amount of armour for a light Tank. The tank is nearly completely covered with composite screens effective against chemical rounds.\n\nThe upper front hull is a heavily sloped 20 mm thick plate covered with composite screens. The lower plate is 20 mm thick and only covered on the upper half with a composite screen. In the front of the vehicle is located the engine and transmission that can absorb any round that may go trough the composite screen. Between the engine and the crew compartment stands a 10 mm thick inner plate that stops most shrapnel that could come from a penetrating shell. The upper side has an outer 6 mm plate and an inner 10 mm plate, both behind a 160 mm composite screen. The lower side has only a 10 mm thick plate that is partly behind the sprocket system that ads another 30 mm and also behind a 80 mm thick composite screen. The rear of the hull is only a 20 mm thick plate. \n\nThe turret is completely covered in 20 mm RHA plates except for the gun mantlet that is 35 mm thick. The Turret is covered from the front to 2/3 of the sides vwith composite screens. The turret roof is only 20 mm thick.\n\n'''Armour type:''' <!-- The types of armour present on the vehicle and their general locations -->\n<!-- Example: * Rolled homogeneous armour (Front, Side, Rear, Hull roof)\n* Cast homogeneous armour (Turret, Transmission area) -->\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Since the magazine carries 24 rounds, it is advisable to fire the weapon in burst of either four or eight rounds with an interval of 2 - 4 seconds in between, especially at range.\n\nHowever, the vehicle's low armour and relatively average speed mean that patience and caution will be what keep you alive long enough to actually ''get'' those kills.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness.

In 1985, the chassis saw development and the first orders for the 40 mm Bofors cannons were done. A year later, in 1986 the prototypes for the Strf 9040 and Strf 9025 were ordered. The prototypes arrived in 1988. The vehicle entered full production in 1993 and is still produced to the present day.<ref name=\"fmv\" />\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=sw_strf_90c Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|2h5kFyznXKU|'''Best IFVs''' discusses the {{PAGENAME}} at 5:19 - ''War Thunder Official Channel''}}\n\n== See also ==\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wikipedia:Combat_Vehicle_90|[Wikipedia] Combat Vehicle 90]]\n\n=== References ===\n\n;Citations\n<references>\n<ref name=\"fmv\">https://web.archive.org/web/20131016061332/http://www.fmv.se/sv/Projekt/Stridsfordon-90/Milstolpar/</ref>\n</references>\n\n{{TankManufacturer BAE Systems AB}}\n{{Sweden light tanks}}"}}
