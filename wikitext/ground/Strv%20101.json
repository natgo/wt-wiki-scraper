In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Swedish medium tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.97 \"Viking Fury\"]]. The Strv 101 is a Centurion Mk.10 purchased from the United Kingdom with Swedish instrumentation and radios.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->\nThe Strv 101 has the same armour layout as the [[Centurion Mk 10]]. Weakpoints are the same, that includes the lower frontal plate and some areas on the turret. The armour can bounce and stop some shells, but shouldn't be relied upon, particularly against HEATFS and APDS shells. The tank also comes with 6 mm thick sideskirts which can occasionally prematurely detonate incoming HEAT shells. The armour plate above the engine is very thin, and can be penetrated by most aircraft cannons and some machine guns.\n\n'''Armour type:'''\n\n* Rolled homogeneous armour (Hull)\n* Cast homogeneous armour (Turret)\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

[[T-44-100]])\n* Good mobility options with neutral steering and sufficient reverse speed\n* Reasonably fast reload speed\n* Smoke grenades can cover up the player when there is danger\n\n'''Cons:'''\n\n* Lower glacis is still a prominent weak spot\n* Mediocre top speed and acceleration\n* No access to HEAT-FS, unlike other nations' L7 guns\n* Engine armour is weak from the top, can be damaged aircraft guns\n* Small internal compartment (only 4 crew members) with ammunition scattered all over\n* Very slow vertical targeting speed\n* Armour becomes weak in an uptier against early APFSDS and HEATFS (eg.

They were bought after the order for the 240 Centurion Mk 3s that were designated Strv 81. The Swedish Army would then upgrade them to the Strv 101R specification in the 1980s which included Renovation and Modifications. The Strv 106 designation, Strv 101Rs upgraded with new suspensions and fire control system, was proposed but never built.\n\n== Media ==\n''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.''\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n;Related development\n* [[Centurion (Family)]]\n** [[Centurion Mk 10]]\n\n== External links ==\n''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.''\n\n{{TankManufacturer Department of Tank Design}}\n{{Sweden medium tanks}}"}}
