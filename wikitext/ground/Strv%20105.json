With new upgrades such as thermal imaging and the m/90C APFSDS round (Swedish designation for the Israeli M426 105 mm APFSDS), it can handle most targets it faces including some later MBTs such as the [[Leopard 2A4]], [[M1 Abrams]], and the [[T-72 (Family)|T-72s]] and [[T-80 (Family)|T-80s]].\n\nIt is best to snipe from a position where the enemy can't see you, as the m/90c round has enough penetration over range to penetrate enemies from a distance, and the armour isn't really strong against other opponents. While it has an upgraded engine, the Strv 105 still is a bit sluggish compared to NATO counterparts and vehicles such as the [[XM-803]] or [[Leopard 1A5]] can beat you in mobility terms. It's best to try to stay cover to cover when moving. Defeating late Cold War-era MBTs in uptiers can be done but thanks to their mobility and gun handling control being more advanced, they will often have a better reaction time than you.\n\n;'''Enemies worth noting:'''\n\n* [[T-72B]], [[T-72B (1989)]] - These Soviet MBTs have their armour increased on the frontal hull and with the 1989 variant featuring CONTACT-5 ERA, it will be impossible to kill them from the front except for a few weak spots. It's best to aim for the lower front plate and the driver port.\n* [[Challenger Mk.2]]/[[Challenger Mk.3]] - The turret of these British tanks will be nearly impossible to penetrate at range, due to how the composite plates are angled. The lower hull can be penetrated though, especially around the driver port or the lower front plate.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as \"bad\", \"good\" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as \"inadequate\" and \"effective\".'' -->\n\n'''Pros:'''\n\n* Access to the m/90c APFSDS shell (aka 105 mm DM63/M426) with good penetration\n* Has access to 2nd generation thermals for the gunner\n* Improved engine\n* ERA stops most HEATFS\n* Stock APFSDS shell\n* NVDs are a Tier II modification\n* Good gun depression (-10°)\n* Has no hull ammo storage next to the driver unlike the preceding [[Strv 104]]\n\n'''Cons:'''\n\n* Mobility is subpar compared to other MBTs\n* Weak armour against most APDS/APFSDS, even from Soviet APHE shells\n* Late Cold War-era vehicles may be difficult to deal with in uptiers\n* Lower front plate has no additional protection\n\n== History ==\n<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction.
