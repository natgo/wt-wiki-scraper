In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Swedish medium tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.97 \"Viking Fury\"]]. The Strv 122 is based on the Leopard 2 improved, but with increased protection.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.''\n\n'''Armour type:''' <!-- The types of armour present on the vehicle and their general locations -->\n<!-- Example: * Rolled homogeneous armour (Front, Side, Rear, Hull roof)\n* Cast homogeneous armour (Turret, Transmission area) -->\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

However, players who have not unlocked it yet, or who cannot afford the cost of said ammunition on an already exorbitantly expensive tank to repair, will be treated to the DM23 round, which, whilst adequate for most targets, is less reliable.\n\nThe gun handling is excellent, featuring a fast turret traverse and fast gun elevation akin to most of its contemporaries, such as the [[M1A2 Abrams|M1A2]] and [[Leopard 2A5]]. The reload is also comparable to the M1A2 and 2A5, being able to go down to 6.0 s. This is slower than other MBTs such as the [[Type 90 (B)]] and [[Challenger 2 (2F)]], and as fast as the [[Leclerc]], which benefits from an autoloader.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"100%\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" | [[kan Strv 122 (120 mm)|120 mm kan Strv 122]] || colspan=\"5\" | Turret rotation speed (°/s) || colspan=\"4\" | Reloading rate (seconds)\n|-\n!
