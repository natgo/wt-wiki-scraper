If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\nThe Strv 81 is an effective medium tank if played to its strengths. If one wants to keep it simple, just use the powerful gun to snipe from distance. More advanced tankers can utilize the not too impressive max speed (35 km/h (22mph)) to move with this medium tank into the flanks of enemy tanks (close to the border of a map) and search for positions like hills and ridges where one can make use of the amazing -10° gun depression to hide the vulnerable lower plate of this tank. Once in such a position, one should use the binoculars to scout for enemies without exposing the turret. If an enemy tank is spotted that could be a potential threat (dangerous tank / faced towards you) pop out a little bit and start to take out the enemies gunner/cannon barrel/cannon breech to prevent him from returning fire. Now utilize the quick reload to take out one crew member after the other to finish your opponent. If an enemy is spotted who is exposing their side or even the rear while not aiming towards you, shoot the engine first to immobilize and possibly even ignite the enemy tank, preventing him to take cover. The next shots should again disable the gun of the enemy, now finish your prey by shooting all crew members or if you feel lucky shoot an ammo rack.\n\nThe best choice to pierce enemy tanks is obviously the slpprj m/54 (APDS) although it is quite expensive in terms of Silver Lions. The slpprj (APCBC) works in most situation as well but lacks penetration compared to the slpprj m/54 APDS shot. The amazing penetration characteristics of this APDS shot enables this gun to pierce front plates of all Panther models (apart from the Panther II) to ranges up to 2000 m. T-44s and Panther IIs front plates can be penetrated to ranges up to almost 1000 m. Keep in mind though that the front plate of the T-44 is angled at 60°, so it bounces even this powerful APDS shot quite often. Even the front plate of the mighty Tiger II is not able to stop this APDS shot if not angled and the range is shorter than 100 m.\n\nIn a head to head situation with an enemy tank approaching try to angle the centurion not more than 5° degrees to either side since the side armour is quite weak (50.8 mm), try to hide your lower front plate which is a massive weak spot, while reloading turn the turret 10° to the right to maximize chances of bouncing shots (right side of the turret front has some extra armour) and keeping the gunner alive.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness.

As the first Centurion type used by the Swedish army, the vehicles were fielded extensively during the Cold War as a counter to the numerous T-54/T-55 MBTs fielded by the Soviet Army. The Strv 81s would later be complemented by the [[Strv 101]], a variant of the Centurion Mk 10, and later followed by the Strv 102 and Strv 104. These \"Swedish Centurions\" would continue service until the introduction of more advanced MBTs such as the Leopard 2 in Swedish service.\n\nAfter the end of the Second World War, Sweden was in a tight spot in terms of armoured vehicles, as the Soviet forces near its borders possessed significant numbers of IS-series and T-44 tanks, along with the wartime-era T-34 tank variants. Most of these tanks far outclassed the Strv m/41 and m/42 tanks that equipped the Swedish army at the time. As a result, Swedish tank designers were immediately tasked with the development of a new medium tank. However, most of these designs failed to produce strong results, and thus, the Swedish army began the search for a new foreign-built medium tank.\n\nThe Swedish army considered two main tank designs: the M46 Patton and the Centurion Mk 3. The Swedish army decided to buy the Centurion, but Britain was unwilling to sell the tanks immediately due to the Korean War. As a result, the Swedish army began considering French-built tanks, notably the AMX-13. However, in late 1952, the British army agreed to sell Sweden 80 Centurion Mk 3 tanks with the order fulfilled 1953-1954. After testing with Swedish specialists, the first 80 Centurion Mk 3s were delivered to Sweden as the Strv 81 - these tanks were virtually identical to the British version.\n\nIn 1955, Sweden ordered an additional 160 Centurion Mk 3s, this time with modifications to the gun barrel to reduce fumes reentering the turret after firing. This made for a total of 240 Strv 81s in Swedish service, replacing the highly obsolete Strv m/41 and m/42 tanks of the wartime era. The Strv 81s were later complemented by the Strv 101s, which were British-built Centurion Mk 10s. Together, the Swedish Centurions served for a long time in Swedish service, later variants serving until 2001 when they were replaced by the variants of the German Leopard 2.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=sw_strv_81 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Images:\n<gallery mode=\"packed-hover\" heights=\"150px\">\nFile:Strv 81 '80401'.jpg|Strv 81 with '80401' Market Camouflage\nFile:Strv 81 Desert (Late).jpg|Strv 81 with Desert (Late) Camouflage\nFile:Strv 81 Quadricolor Deforming.jpg|Strv 81 with Quadricolor Deforming Camouflage\nFile:Strv 81 Standard.jpg|Strv 81 with Standard Camouflage\nFile:Strv 81 Tricolor Summer.jpg|Strv 81 with Tricolor Summer Camouflage\nFile:Strv 81 Tricolor Winter Deforming.jpg|Strv 81 with Tricolor Winter Deforming Camouflage\nFile:Strv 81 Unicolor Winter.jpg|Strv 81 with Unicolor Winter Camouflage\n</gallery>\n\n== See also ==\n<!--''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''-->\n{{main|Centurion (Family)}}\n\n;Vehicles equipped with the same chassis\n\n* [[Strv 81 (RB 52)]]\n* [[Strv 81 (RB 52) (Great Britain)]]\n* [[Centurion Mk 3]]\n\n;Related development\n\n* [[Strv 101]]\n* [[Strv 104]]\n* [[Strv 105]]\n\n;Similar role vehicles\n\n* [[M47]]\n* [[M48A1]]\n* [[Leopard 1]]\n* [[T-54 (1947)]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!--''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.''-->\n\n;Bibliography\n\nRickard O.
