If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\n\nThe Strv m/38 provides the player with a fast, manoeuvrable light tank boasting effective firepower for its BR. As a light tank, the armour cannot be relied upon to stop enemy fire, being too weak to stop even .50 cal MG fire. However, it has access to APDS, which allows it to punch through all opponents at its BR and even most tanks a rank above. Because of the excellent APDS shell, it is advised to keep it as your primary shell, but keep a few APBC shells to finish lighter opponents, as the APDS has poor post-penetration damage.\n\nEven with weak armour, the Strv m/38 can be reliably depended upon even in uptiers with its speed, and as well as its penetration power (with the APDS shell), matching the likes of the German [[Pz.III]] series. The only drawback to this shell is the poor post-penetration damage, which calls for a playstyle relying on well-placed shots on enemy vehicles. This is why it's advised to aim for the turret or engine using the APDS shell, when unsure if your APBC shell will actually penetrate at all.\n\nOn rough uneven terrain, a viable tactic is to use your excellent gun depression to hit tanks on from a hull-down position.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics.

The Strv m/38 was the earliest variant of the L-60 accepted into Swedish service, with 15 ordered in 1937 and delivered in 1939. Unlike other exported variants of the L-60, the m/38 did not see combat use due to Swedish neutrality during the Second World War.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=sw_strv_m38 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n;Related development\n\n* [[Toldi IIA]]\n\n== External links ==\n''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.''\n\n{{TankManufacturer AB Landsverk}}\n{{Sweden light tanks}}"}}
