Subsequently, the Scania vabis factory began to produce this tank and obtained the number strv m/41. The Swedish self-produced tank is named strv m/41, with a total weight of 11 tons, a length of 4.6 meters, a width of 2.14 meters, and a height of 2.35 meters. The overall design is similar to the early model of Panzer 38 (T). The armor thickness of the body and the front of the turret is 25 mm. It uses a four person car set, and the engine is a Scania Vasby 1664 gasoline engine, with an output power of 142 horsepower, a maximum road speed of 42 km / h, and a maximum travel of 200 km. Strv m/41 uses Swedish made weapons. The main gun is a bofoss 37mm m/38 tank gun, that is, the vehicle mounted bofoss 37mm anti tank gun, which can penetrate 55mm vertical armor at a distance of 200 meters, and the auxiliary weapon is two 8mm m/39 machine guns. Compared with the original Czech version, the strv m/41 model has detailed differences in appearance. The most obvious is the addition of a periscope above the loader seat on the top of the turret, and the shape of the rear of the turret is also different. Because it took a lot of time to digest the technology and set up the production line, the strv m/41 tank was delivered in December 1942 and completed in August 1943. It was initially equipped with the third Armored Regiment.''\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.''\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n{{main|LT-38 (Family)}}\n\n;Vehicles equipped with the same chassis\n\n* [[Strv m/41 S-II]]\n\n;Related development\n\n* [[Spj fm/43-44]]\n* [[Sav m/43 (1944)]]\n* [[Sav m/43 (1946)]]\n* [[Pvkv II]]\n* [[Pbv 301]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.''\n\n{{TankManufacturer Scania}}\n{{Sweden light tanks}}\n{{Sweden premium ground vehicles}}"}}
