In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Swedish light tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.97 \"Viking Fury\"]]. It is a Swedish license-built version of the Czechoslovak TNHP light tank, and is thus quite similar to the German [[Pz.38(t) F|PzKpfw 38(t)]].\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->\nThe Strv m/41 S-II's frontal armour is 50 mm thick both on the hull and turret, making the front the strongest armoured area of the vehicle. Compared to the [[Pz.38(t) F]], the Strv m/41 S-II has weaker side and rear armour making those areas easily penetrable by enemy guns. So the Strv m/41 S-II's strength in armour is by having the front pointing towards enemies at all times. The engine deck is only 10 mm thick, and is vulnerable to strafing aircraft with cannons or  heavy machine guns.\n\n'''Armour type:'''\n* Rolled homogeneous armour (hull, turret. cupola)\n* Cast homogeneous armour (MG ports, commander and gunner viewports, gun mantlet)\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->\n\nThe Strv m/41 S-II has one advantage over its counterpart [[Pz.38(t) F]] and that is higher horsepower, but it's also a bit heavier by 0.8 tons. The mobility of the Strv m/41 S-II is also almost identical to that of the PzKpfw 38(t) Ausf. F. It is more sluggish than the other Swedish tanks such as the [[Strv m/40L]], with a lower top speed and a rather slow reverse gear.\n\n{{tankMobility|abMinHp=256|rbMinHp=146}}\n\n=== Modifications and economy ===\n{{Specs-Economy}}\n\n== Armaments ==\n{{Specs-Tank-Armaments}}\n=== Main armament ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Weapon|1}}\n<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun.

The Strv m/41 S-II has slpprj m/38 and slpprj m/39 APBC rounds which can penetrate the more lightly-armoured vehicles and has some trouble with angles. However, the Strv m/41 S-II can easily take on heavier armoured vehicles once 3,7 cm slpprj m/49 APDS round is unlocked.\n\nThe part that truly differentiates the Strv m/41 from its German cousin is the gun. The Strv m/41 uses a Swedish-made 3,7 cm kan m/38 instead of the original Czechoslovak Skoda 37 mm cannon. Its performance with the '''slpprj m/38''' and '''slpgr m/39''' APBC rounds is similar to that of the Czechoslovak gun, but the Swedish gun also has access to the outstanding '''slpprj m/49''' APDS round. This round will easily penetrate anything the Strv m/41 can normally face, though it lacks the lethality of the German APCBC with explosive filler.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"100%\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" | [[kan m/38 (37 mm)|37 mm kan m/38]] || colspan=\"5\" | Turret rotation speed (°/s) || colspan=\"4\" | Reloading rate (seconds)\n|-\n!

Refrain from creating a \"guide\" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\nThe Strv m/41 S-II has a similar playstyle as the [[Pz.38(t) F]], though the Strv m/41 S-II has one particular advantage: its APDS rounds that can penetrate most enemy vehicles at its battle rating.\n\nHaving APDS at such a low battle rating makes the Strv m/41 S-II a great vehicle to do ambushes in and deal with heavier armoured vehicles like [[B1 bis]] and [[M4A3 (105)]] if it can get the first shell fired into a vital spot. It also gives the Strv m/41 S-II the capabilities to fight at longer ranges than its opponents , making the armour of the vehicle more efficient. The main drawback with APDS is its comparatively weak post-penetration damage,  having to pick off the crew of larger vehicles like [[T-28 (Family)|T-28]] and [[LVT(A)(1)]] one by one.\n\nThe Strv m/41 S-II shines if it gets to fight a vehicle on its terms, meaning to keep at a distance and wear the enemy down by using the APDS shells. The 50 mm frontal armour can be a saving grace in close quarters combat, but with the weak side armour it's best to keep distance instead rushing in. The Strv m/41 S-II can also shine in ambushes and hull-down positions where the enemy has to advance to it or do not know where it is, and it can get good shots on their sides. However, the tank can also be effective in direct confrontation, even if it is not the ideal situation.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness.

S. Sweden still needed the light tanks, and after negotiations the Swedish manufacturer Scania-Vabis was allowed to produce them under license, and compensation for the lost tanks. Sweden ordered 116 Strv M/41 SI in June, 1941. The Stridsvagn M/41 was armed with a 37 mm Bofors m/38 gun, was powered by a Scania-Vabis Type 1664 engine, and the design utilized riveted construction. In June of 1942, Sweden ordered 122 Strv M/41 SII. The SII featured a number of improvements over the SI. The armour was increased from 25 mm to 50 mm thick. Because of the added weight of the armour, a more powerful engine was added, the Type L 603 engine. This necessitated an elongation of the hull by 65 mm. The fuel tanks were increased from 190 litres to 230 litres. 104 of the SII model were built, with the last 18 being built as the Sav M/43, a casemate assault gun using a 75 mm gun, and later a 105 mm gun. Another 18 Sav M/43 were purpose-built afterwards. The Strv M/41 served until the late 1950s, when all Strv M/41 were converted to the Pansarbandvagn (Pbv) 301, an armoured personnel carrier. The turrets were used in static fortifications.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=sw_strv_m41_s2 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|4_cJ1CpEatw|'''Best gun depression'''  discusses the {{PAGENAME}} at 0:51 - ''War Thunder Official Channel''}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n{{main|LT-38 (Family)}}\n;Vehicles equipped with the same chassis\n* [[Strv m/41 S-I]]\n;Related development\n* [[Spj fm/43-44]]\n* [[Sav m/43 (1944)]]\n* [[Sav m/43 (1946)]]\n* [[Pvkv II]]\n* [[Pbv 301]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wikipedia:Stridsvagn_m/41|[Wikipedia] Stridsvagn m/41]]\n\n=== References ===\n;Bibliography\n* David B.
