In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Swedish medium tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.97 \"Viking Fury\"]].\n\nIt is a further development of the [[Lago I]] medium tank.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->\nThe Strv m/42 has increased frontal protection compared to the Lago I. Both the hull and turret fronts have a maximum thickness of 55 mm, which provides good resistance against small calibre anti-tank guns and autocannon fire. However, the side and rear are still quite thin, and are only resistant against heavy machine guns. The engine deck and turret roof are only 9 and 10 mm thick respectively, and are thus vulnerable to aircraft cannon and heavy machine gun fire.\n\nDespite this increase in armour, the Strv m/42 can still be easily penetrated by the upgraded guns that come with the shift from 2.7 to 3.0. Notably, the [[Panzer III (Family)|long barreled Panzer III's]], [[M4A1]], [[Chi-Nu]], and the [[P40]]'s HEAT round can all cut right through your armour like paper. It is highly recommended to avoid head-on engagements with these opponents, although you can compete with the Chi-Nu and P40 if you manage to get the first shot off due to their relatively weak armour.\n\nWhen being up-tiered to 4.0, the Strv m/42 will have to play like a light tank flanker, as any gun at 4.0 can penetrate it and the m/42's cannon will rarely frontally penetrate due to the increase in armour. The worst enemies for the m/42 to face at 4.0 are the [[Pz.IV F2]], [[T-34E STZ]], [[T-34-57]], [[Achilles]], [[M4A2]] and [[Breda 501]]. All of these tanks can either punch right through the Strv's armour and/or are virtually invulnerable to its cannon frontally, with the exceptions being the Breda 501 and the Pz.IV F2.\n\n'''Armour Type:'''\n\n* Rolled Homogeneous Armour (hull, turret, cupola)\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->\n\n{{tankMobility|abMinHp= 635|rbMinHp= 363}}\n\nThe Strv m/42 is considerably heavier than the Lago I, but the engine is uprated to compensate for the increased weight. The mobility is therefore not significantly affected and is quite adequate for a medium tank of its tier. It has a relatively low reverse speed and the long hull relative to its width also has a noticeable impact on its turning ability.\n\n=== Modifications and economy ===\n{{Specs-Economy}}\n\n== Armaments ==\n{{Specs-Tank-Armaments}}\n=== Main armament ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Weapon|1}}\n<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun.

Give advice on how to use them and how to fill the ammunition storage.'' -->\n{{main|kan m/41 (75 mm)}}\n\nThe Strv m/42 is armed with the '''7,5 cm kan m/41''', the same 75 mm field gun found on the [[Ikv 72]]. While quite respectable on the Ikv 72, the gun is not quite as competitive on the Strv m/42 due to the heavier opposition it will face, such as the [[Churchill (Family)|Churchill]] and [[KV-1 (Family)|KV]] heavy tanks. The turret does provide an excellent amount of gun depression (15°), allowing for more hull-down opportunities.\n\nLike on the Ikv 72, the gun starts off with the '''slpprj m/40''' uncapped AP shot, which unfortunately tends to suffer ricochets against the sloped armour that is increasingly common at the Strv m/42's BR. The gun may also be upgraded to fire the '''slpgr m/39''' uncapped APHE shell and the '''slpprj m/40B''' APBC shot. The APHE round has a very lethal 260 g TNT filler but tends to ricochet more and has less penetration than the other rounds. It is best used when presented with sideshots against tanks with weak side armour. The APBC ricochets less, although the penetration is still rather inadequate. It is recommended to carry a mixture of both APHE and APBC.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"100%\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" | [[kan m/41 (75 mm)|75 mm kan m/41]] || colspan=\"5\" | Turret rotation speed (°/s) || colspan=\"4\" | Reloading rate (seconds)\n|-\n!

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\nThe Strv m/42 EH is a fairly conventional medium tank that distinguishes itself with its excellent gun depression. It thus excels in hull-down positions or ridge-fighting. However, the gun is quite weak and will struggle in uptiers against angled and well armoured tanks. Enemy tanks like [[KV-1 (Family)|KV-1]] and [[Churchill (Family)|Churchill]] are almost untouchable for the Strv m/42 EH to take head-on, but also tanks like [[T-34 (Family)|T-34]] and [[M4 Sherman (Family)|M4 Sherman]] can be quite troublesome as well to face head-on with the Strv m/42 EH's short 75mm. If Strv m/42 is played properly it can be a troublesome tank to deal with for the enemy as well. Strv m/42 has a relatively decent armour for its battle rating, and the turret armour is well rounded for shells to bounce off it. The Strv m/42 EH's modest mobility and high profile makes it not the best for flanking manoeuvres, but its excellent gun depression makes it a great tank for ambushes from hills and elevated positions. Where the 75 mm is not enough for frontal engagement, it's best to retreat and find a position where the gun can take a shot at the enemy vehicle's side or rear armour.\n\nThe Strv m/42 EH gun has got one of the worst penetration shells for a medium tank at its battle rating. The Slpprj m/40 (AP) and m/40B (APBC) rounds got a top penetration of 85 mm at 10 metre range. It's enough when facing its own battle rating peers and when downtiered, but really lacks the penetration for an uptier battle. The Strv m/42 EH has also got a third shell, the slpgr m/39 (APHE) that will deal the most damage if it is able to penetrate the target. However, the Slpgr m/39 only has 63 mm penetration at 10 metre range, which makes it efficient at 2.0 downtier and almost useless in a uptiered situation. But if the Strv m/42 EH manages to flank and hit the enemies from the side, the shells will be able to penetrate and destroy enemy targets with relative ease, although it might struggle against heavy tanks like [[KV-1 (Family)|KV-1]] and [[Churchill (Family)|Churchill]] still.\n\nTargets the Strv m/42 EH should be aware of are tanks like:\n* [[T-34 (Family)|T-34]]: With its 76mm main gun and sloped front armour it can pose a big threat to the Strv m/42 in close-ranged combats where the T-34 got better acceleration and mobility.\n* [[M4 Sherman (Family)|M4 Sherman]]: With its 75mm and sloped front will, like the T-34, pose a major threat at close range for the Strv m/42, mainly when forced in a frontal confrontation.\n* [[Pz.IV]] H/G/F2 and [[Panzer III (Family)|Panzer III]]'s with long barrels: These will be a threat for the Strv m/42 at medium to long range, but the flat frontal armour will make them a easy target for the Strv m/42 if it manages to get them into close range confrontations.\n* [[KV-1 (Family)|KV-1]] and [[Churchill (Family)|Churchill]] tanks: These are well-armoured and well-equipped to deal with the firepower and armour that the Strv m/42 possess. These tanks are major threats and will most likely force the Strv m/42 to retreat or ask for help from a player with a better anti-tank gun.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness.

When Sweden in 1942 requested a new heavy tank from AB Landsverk that was going to be over 10 ton but below 22 ton mark and armed with a 75 mm cannon, this gave AB Landsverk the opportunity to continue development of the Lago I. In Swedish use it would be designated Strv m/42 and would come in 3 different versions during the second world war, the first version Strv m/42 TM, second TH which would have same engines as the TM but a new hydromechanical gearbox from Lysholm-Smith, third version EH which only had one engine with a newly developed A8B engine from Volvo while TM and TH used two Scania-Vabis 603/1 engines. EH also got a hydromechanical gearbox from Lysholm-Smith but this was larger and improved compared to the TH version.\n\nOnly 57 of the 282 Strv m/42 tanks ordered were produced to the EH standard, TM and TH being the other 225. Strv m/42 was a tank that was quickly outdated when it arrived, lacking in armour and firepower when they were being deployed. The Germans and Soviets had gone from short 75 mm to longer and heavier calibre guns when the tanks were being delivered from 1943 to 1945. And in middle of 1950's when Sweden bought in the Strv 81 the Strv m/42 was replaced with, Strv m/42s got refitted and rebuilt, Strv m/42 TM that had changed to TV with a new gearbox, TM/TV along with TH got rebuilt to Light Tank Strv 74 with their turrets used for coastal and airfield defenses, meanwhile Strv m/42 EH got repurposed for infantry support and got redesignated as Ikv 73.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Images\n<gallery mode=\"packed-hover\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Strv m 42 Sweden.png|Strv m/42 in Sweden\n</gallery>\n\n;Media\n{{Youtube-gallery|hcvwEs84aTs|'''The Shooting Range #194''' - ''Pages of History'' section at 04:08 discusses the Strv m/42.}}\n\n== See also ==\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''encyclopedia page on the tank;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n\n* David B.
