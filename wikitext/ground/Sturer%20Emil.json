In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' (officially ''12,8 cm Selbstfahrlafette auf VK30.01(H)'' (12.8 cm Self-Propelled on VK 30.01 (Henschel))) is a rank {{Specs|rank}} German tank destroyer {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.59 \"Flaming Arrows\"]].\n\nThe Sturer Emil is quite similar to the [[Dicker Max]]; no armour, excellent gun, great gun depression. Due to its limited horizontal gun traverse, it can be a little trickier to use in urban maps, but it can still be used to guard positions as long as cover is available. Being unarmoured, always avoid being shot at.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->\nThe Sturer Emil is typical of the German open-topped tank destroyers: fragile and particularly vulnerable to HE shells, artillery strike and air attacks. With a maximum of 50 mm of armour, the best protection is to not get shot at in the first place.\n\nThe sides of the superstructure are covered by ammunition and any clean hit on the Sturer Emil is likely to detonate the ammunition. The loader also stands in a particularly exposed position at the back of the tank destroyer, where he is very vulnerable to stray bullets or shrapnel. The rest of the crew is fairly spread out, which means that it is not easy to get a crew knock-out with one shot.\n\n'''Armour type:'''\n\n* Rolled homogeneous armour\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->\nBased on the VK 30.01 (H) heavy tank chassis, the Sturer Emil has very lacklustre mobility thanks to the weak engine. It is not very well suited to mobile, fast moving battles, and cannot relocate easily.\n\n{{tankMobility|abMinHp=440|rbMinHp=274}}\n\n=== Modifications and economy ===\n{{Specs-Economy}}\n\n== Armaments ==\n{{Specs-Tank-Armaments}}\n=== Main armament ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Weapon|1}}\n<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun. Assess its effectiveness in a battle based on the reloading speed, ballistics and the power of shells. Do not forget about the flexibility of the fire, that is how quickly the cannon can be aimed at the target, open fire on it and aim at another enemy. Add a link to the main article on the gun: <code><nowiki>{{main|Name of the weapon}}</nowiki></code>. Describe in general terms the ammunition available for the main gun. Give advice on how to use them and how to fill the ammunition storage.'' -->\n{{main|K.40 (128 mm)}}\n\nThe 128 mm K.40 is easily the most powerful gun carried by any vehicle within the Sturer Emil's BR range, and it is a very deadly threat; it is capable of frontally penetrating any vehicle the Sturer Emil faces. On top of that, the APC shells have a massive amount of explosive filler, all but guaranteeing a one-shot kill upon penetration. It should be noted, however, that the APC shells have a 19 mm fuse threshold, and are likely to penetrate lightly armoured vehicles without exploding.\n\nConversely, the large size and weight of the 128 mm shells result in a long reload time. If the loader is knocked out, the reload time is massively increased, crippling the tank destroyer. The vehicle is also not very spacious, resulting in an ammunition capacity of only 15 rounds. The gun also has a limited amount of elevation and traverse, which can make it rather difficult to bring the gun to bear in some situations. This, combined with the lack of any machine guns, also renders the Sturer Emil virtually helpless against aircraft.\n\nThe Sturer Emil platform also provides the gun with an excellent gun depression angles, allowing the Sturer Emil to go hull-down on relatively steep slopes while exposing very little of the vehicle. The gun is mounted near the top of the superstructure as well, which allows the Sturer Emil to use its gun while exposing very little of the vehicle.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"100%\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" | [[K.40 (128 mm)|128 mm K.40]] || colspan=\"5\" | Turret rotation speed (°/s) || colspan=\"4\" | Reloading rate (seconds)\n|-\n!

Refrain from creating a \"guide\" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\nThere are two ways one can use the Sturer Emil in combat:\n\n'''Direct Engagement'''\n\nIn other words, how one would typically use a tank destroyer of this type - find a good vantage point, and use your gun's impressive long range penetration to destroy even heavy tanks. When doing so, keep in mind to make as much use of your tank's depression as possible, and backing away from the open when reloading, as that is when most tanks will attempt to take you out.\n\nDon't even think of trying to use the Sturer Emil in an \"offensive\" capability, the vehicle does not have the mobility nor armour to do so. Use it in an ambush-style method and conceal the vehicle before pouncing on the enemy. A spotted Sturer Emil is vulnerable to flanking manoeuvres, artillery, and air strikes.\n\n'''Indirect Fire'''\n[[File:Sturer Emil Indirect Firing Method.gif|x480px|thumb|right|Step-by-step procedure to \"Indirect fire\", note how the Sturer Emil conceals itself past the hill slope while able to use the cannon to lob shells over to the enemies downrange. (''View image if .gif is not playing'')]]\n\nOne of the greatest capabilities of large calibre guns on vehicles like the Sturer Emils is that they allow you to take advantage of their high angle of projectile drop. This method works great beyond 1,000 metres, but varies depending on the type of terrain and hull-down positions are available on the map.\n\nWhen on long range maps like [[Sands of Sinai]] or [[Maginot Line]], drive to places where you are on the back slope of a hill relative to potential targets. From there, <u>do not poke out</u> and stay behind the hill slope to use it as cover and concealment against the enemy downrange. This way, the enemy has no way of spotting/engaging the Sturer Emil from their angle, but the Sturer Emil can still certainly see and hit the enemies. To do this, use the binoculars to look over the hill for long range targets. Adjust for the range to the target from behind the hill so when you fire, the round will essentially be fired over your cover (due to the necessary adjustment to your gun's elevation to hit targets at distance), with the rate of projectile drop creating a parabola trajectory for the round to come back down from over the hilltop into the target below, allowing you to essentially hit targets who cannot even see your position.\n\nAnother benefit of this method is being able to maintain position during reloading (as opposed to receding to cover as stated in the \"direct engagement\" section) meaning that while you wait for reload, you can correct your aim for range and target heading, allowing you to home into where you need to aim to make accurate hits.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as \"bad\", \"good\" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as \"inadequate\" and \"effective\".'' -->\n\n'''Pros:'''\n\n* Outstanding gun depression, same as the [[Dicker Max]]\n* Extremely powerful gun with very lethal APHE shells for great post-penetration damages\n* It is almost impossible to knock out the tank with a single shot, as the 5 crew members are well spread out.\n* Good gun placement high in the superstructure\n* Massive gun breech that can shield some of the crew against enemy shells\n* Side armour is 30 mm thick, unusually thick for an open topped vehicle - can shrug off large calibre machine guns and even some autocannons\n\n'''Cons:'''\n\n* Poor mobility, can get flanked easily by other tanks\n* Long reload time and limited ammunition capacity\n* Exposed loader\n* Very vulnerable to airstrikes due to open top\n* Limited gun traverse and elevation angles\n* Poor armour\n\n== History ==\n<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block \"/History\" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template.

This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->\nThe '''Selbstfahrlafette auf VK30.01(H)''', or better known as the '''Sturer Emil''' (''Stubborn Emil''), was a heavy self-propelled anti-tank gun developed by Nazi Germany sometime in 1941 and 1942. The Sturer Emil mounted the extremely large 12.8 cm gun on a extended chassis from the cancelled Henschel VK 30.01 armoured vehicle. The gun was laid on the back with the engine in the middle and the driver up front.\n\nNot too much is known about the vehicle, only two were ever made in 1942, but they were involved in the Battle of Stalingrad. One was destroyed, but the other was captured during that battle in January 1943. When it was discovered, painting on the barrel indicates a score of 31 tank kills before its demise. The sole remaining Sturer Emil remains at the Kubinka Tank Museum in Russia.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=germ_pzsflk40_sturer_emil Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|zesNf8kYsKg|'''The Shooting Range #229''' - ''Pages of History'' section at 03:29 discusses the {{PAGENAME}}.|4_cJ1CpEatw|'''Best gun depression'''  discusses the {{PAGENAME}} at 1:33 - ''War Thunder Official Channel''|GsCIbQ6TKIQ|'''German ground forces Rank III- review and analysis''' talks about the Sturer Emil at 4:30 - ''Oxy''|WBb2WJkfucI|'''Sturer Emil Tank Review''' - ''NUSensei''}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n* [[Dicker Max]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wt:en/news/3752-development-sturer-emil-en|[Devblog] Sturer Emil]]\n* [[wikipedia:Sturer_Emil|[Wikipedia] Sturer Emil]]\n\n{{Germany tank destroyers}}"}}
