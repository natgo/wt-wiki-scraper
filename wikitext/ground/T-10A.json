In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium gift rank {{Specs|rank}} Soviet heavy tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced during [[Update \"New Power\"]] as a reward for [[Battle Pass: Season I]].\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->\nThe armour protection of the hull, as it is a T-10 hull, is very good except against powerful APDS, APFSDS, HEATFS and ATGMs. In a downtier the armour will work well against the majority of vehicles, however chemical rounds such as HEAT shells and ATGMs will have no issues penetrating the hull as well as APFSDS shells. Moving to the turret, it is poorly armoured even against APDS beside the gun breech. The turret may stop APCBC and some APDS shells but should not be relied on to stop HEAT and ATGM nor APFSDS.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Armour !! Front (Slope angle) !! Sides !! Rear !!

Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->\n\nIn terms of mobility, the T10A lacks speed as well as agility. But it can been seen as quite fast for a heavy tank, the horsepower generated by the engine makes this a beast when moving obstacles and even dead tanks. The mass can be seen as a pro and a con. Due to heavy mass, it has more traction and will not be flipped by explosions or pushed so easily by tanks. However, the mass reduced drastically the top speed as well as the acceleration.\n\n{{tankMobility|abMinHp=1,085|rbMinHp=619}}\n\n=== Modifications and economy ===\n{{Specs-Economy}}\n\n== Armaments ==\n{{Specs-Tank-Armaments}}\n\n=== Main armament ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Weapon|1}}\n<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun.

The T-10A's gun is powerful but for targets such as the M-103, you will have a hard time killing due to its effective armour. Your reload time is also very long, you can expect around an 18-second reload which is way less than a IS-3 or IS-4 but still long. When taking a enemy position or cap, try bringing at least 2 allies to help and support you. Since it is a Soviet tank you have a low gun depression of 3°, so avoid positions that need gun depression like hills or rough terrain. One special feature that sets the T-10A from other heavy Soviet tanks is a stabilizer which makes a huge difference in combat, however this works only at lower speeds. You also have a 12.7 mm DShK machine gun to take out lightly- armoured targets, planes, or helicopters.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness.

It included a single-plane stabilizer which allowed the gun to be fired accurately while moving. It was developed in 1956, and was later succeeded by the T-10B, and finally the [[T-10M]].\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=ussr_t_10a Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Images\n<gallery mode=\"packed-hover\">\nImage:T-10A Devblog Image 001.jpg|<small>T-10A devblog image</small>\n</gallery>\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|OR18NRGT7uw|'''The Shooting Range #254''' - ''Pages of History'' section at 03:03 discusses the T-10.|gENL-q_x5Tc|'''SOVIET SUFFERING: T-10A Review''' - ''Sako Sniper''|MsSxTpwTq-I|'''The Heavy Problem - T-10A''' - ''JustinPlaysYT''}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n;Vehicles equipped with the same chassis\n\n* [[T-10M]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wikipedia:T-10_tank|[Wikipedia] T-10 tank]]\n\n{{TankManufacturer ChTZ}}\n{{USSR heavy tanks}}\n{{USSR premium ground vehicles}}"}}
