In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium rank {{Specs|rank}} Soviet light tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.41#19.06.2014 - 1.41.27.12|Update 1.41.27]]. \n\nThe T-26 (1st Gv.T.Br) is a premium version of the [[T-26]], and is identical except in its special winter camo, of a T-26 of the 1st Guards Tank Brigade during the Battle of Moscow.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->\n[[File:T-26 3.jpg|thumb]]\nThis is definitively the worst characteristic of this vehicle: armour is flat and thin on all sides. Do not expose yourself to enemy fire. Crew placement is not lined up from the front, meaning shells without HE filler can take up to 3 shots before being destroyed. Beware HMG and autocannons.\n\n'''Armour type:'''\n\n* Rolled homogeneous armour\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Armour !! Front !! Sides !! Rear !!

Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->\n\nWhile being a light tank, its mobility is one of a medium tank. The top speed is very, very low for a light tank, combined with the low power to weight ratio given by its weak engine, the T-26 has poor acceleration and speed on most surfaces. It can reach around 30 km/h only on hard, flat surface, after a long, uninterrupted acceleration period. With even a small turn the speed will drop significantly. The narrow tracks significantly reduce its off-road mobility in muddy, sandy or snowy maps. Despite the tracks being short and far apart, the T-26 still has slow hull traverse and often needs a forward/backward jerk to start turning properly. Reverse speed is also very poor (-4 km/h), which cannot save you from most bad situations.\n\nIt will eventually take you where you want to be, provided that you are a very patient player, choose your route well, and avoid too many tricky turns.\n\n{{tankMobility|abMinHp=141|rbMinHp=80}}\n\n=== Modifications and economy ===\n{{Specs-Economy}}\n\n== Armaments ==\n{{Specs-Tank-Armaments}}\n=== Main armament ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Weapon|1}}\n<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun.

Players should get used to it since it will be your main armament up until rank II. The APHEBC round has a good amount of HE filler, meaning penetrating shells will do good damage, sometimes even knocking out enemies with a single shot. In longer ranges, shells begin to lose penetration and accuracy; it is not made for sniping. Try to bring ~10-15 BR-240SP (pure AP shells) for heavier targets. This gun is very forgiving to beginners, with its very fast reload speed and turret traverse.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"100%\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" | [[20-K (45 mm)|45 mm 20-K]] || colspan=\"5\" | Turret rotation speed (°/s) || colspan=\"4\" | Reloading rate (seconds)\n|-\n!

The T-26 is also usable at closer ranges for brawling with enemy vehicles, but it should be kept in mind that the thin armour on the T-26 (≤15 mm) will leave the vital modules of your vehicle such as your crew, gun & powerplant (engine & transmission) at risk of taking damage, the mobility of the T-26 is also lesser than many of its counterparts which could potentially put it at risk in a brawling scenario, on the other hand the T-26's good reload (3.77 - 2.9s) will usually give it an upper hand if you can survive the first shots against an enemy vehicle.\n\nDue to the top speed of the T-26 being less than many other vehicles at its BR (30 km/h), it will usually arrive to the battlefield after the fighting has already begun, this has the advantage of arriving after your team has already identified many targets, and also meaning that you will not be in the front line of attack, this will usually allow for you to last a bit longer than players who rushed the centre of the battlefield, alternatively it is also less likely that you will reach capture points before they are capped by your faster teammates although there are cases where you can help capture a contested point.\n\nThe lack of armour is really something to be kept in mind, even some machine guns (8 mm, 12.7 mm) will be able to go through you thickest pieces of armour (15 mm), due to this you want to be trying your best to avoid enemy vehicles getting the first shot, driving in cover is advisable to avoid being spotted and if you spot an enemy vehicle it would be best to engage and destroy them as soon as possible to avoid them becoming a threat, due to the lack of effective armour, aircraft can also be a risk, again, staying in cover will make it more difficult for enemy vehicles to spot and engage your T-26.\n\nIn terms of the T-26's gun there are 2 round options, the APHEBC round has 70 mm best effective penetration as well as an explosive filler, this will allow for this round to penetrate most armour at this BR and also have good post-penetration damage if the fuse is set off. Second round type is an AP round, this has 73 mm best effective penetration but lacks any explosive filler, this makes its post-penetration damage less effective than the APHEBC round. Moreinfo on both these rounds can be found in the Ammunition section above.\n\nIt is also worth keeping in mind that the reverse speed is only -3 km/h, so you will have to be careful when driving out into potential enemy fire.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as \"bad\", \"good\" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as \"inadequate\" and \"effective\".'' -->\n\n'''Pros:'''\n\n* Great firepower; the stock shell has 69 mm maximum penetration and 32 g TNT which can frontally penetrate many tanks\n* Even in an up-tier situation it can still effectively penetrate tanks like the B1\n* Massive ammo capacity and fast reload time is good for new players who are learning to aim\n* Premium bonuses thanks to its premium status\n\n'''Cons:'''\n\n* Very low survivability; the armour is thin, not angled and is only 15 mm max. Can get frontally penetrated by anything like the Pz.II, Pz.III and even heavy MG.\n* The three crew members are packed tightly together significantly reduces survivability\n* Poor mobility overall; has low top speed limited manoeuvrability around the battlefield, the weak engine doesn't allow it to climb hills\n* The narrow tracks slow it in desert maps like Sinai or snowy maps like Frozen Pass\n* The slow reverse speed of only -3 km/h is very fatal as it cannot back away from danger in time\n* Average turret rotation combined with the sluggish hull traverse prevents it from responding to flanks quickly\n* Average -5° gun depression limits its potential in hilly terrains\n* Some ammo is stored inside turret which tends to explode when hit\n\n== History ==\n<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction.

Then it saw combat against the Japanese in the Soviet-Japanese border conflicts at Lake Khasan and Khalkhin Gol, which exposed some of the design defects such as poor armour welding and the disadvantages of riveted constructions (the rivet would break off and could harm the crew inside). After that, the T-26 saw service in the Invasion of Poland and the Winter War against Finland. The Winter War effectively showed the Soviets that the T-26 was obsolete, as the 37 mm guns and anti-tank rifles and Finnish have could penetrate the light armour of the T-26. When World War II for the Soviet Union finally broke out in Operation Barbarossa, the T-26 proved inferior to the German's [[Pz.III F|Panzer IIIs]] and [[Pz.IV F1|Panzer IVs]], plus the air supremacy of the Luftwaffe ensured many tanks were lost in the opening stages of Barbarossa.\n\nThe T-26 at this point also was breaking down and the lack of spare parts made repairs hard, resulting in multiple T-26 units also being knocked out for being irrecoverable. The T-26 was gradually phased from service by the new, venerable [[T-34 (1941)|T-34]] medium tanks, which gave Germany a run for their money. The T-26 still saw service in the war as a second-line unit, as it was still fighting in the Battle of Moscow of 1941, Stalingrad of 1942, and in Manchuria in 1945. Some T-26 even saw action in the '''1st Guards Tank Brigade''' (1st Gv.T.Br.), but these were quickly replaced by the more venerable T-34.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=ussr_t_26_1940_1st_GvTBr Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Images\n<gallery mode=\"packed-hover\"  heights=\"200\">\nFile:T-26_(1st_Gv.T.Br.)
