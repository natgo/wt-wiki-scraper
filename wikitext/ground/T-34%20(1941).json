In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Soviet medium tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced during the Closed Beta Test for Ground Forces before [[Update 1.41]].\n\nAn improvement over the [[T-34 (1940)]] with the older [[L-11 (76 mm)|76 mm L-11]] cannon replaced with the [[F-34 (76 mm)|76 mm F-34]] cannon. The F-34 presents overall better penetration values with all armour-piercing rounds. Armour and mobility on the {{PAGENAME}} are otherwise unchanged.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection.

Never let your enemies see your sides, as they are thinner, less angled and your enemies can easily penetrate it. The turret is still 45 mm thick, but much less angled. If your enemy penetrates your turret with APHE shells, you're a goner. Always angle your armour.\n\nThe T-34 has a crew of 4 men packed tightly together, and one shot could incapacitate a few crew members. The ammunition is conveniently stored below the tank, making it difficult to detonate. If you carry a decreased ammunition load, preferably 15-30 shells, the enemy would have a hard time detonating your ammo. However, shrapnel from a HE shell shot below you can be dangerous, especially when you encounter a [[Ho-Ro]], for example. The engine is the module most of your opponents will target. Parts and FPE should be researched to be able to survive the shots targeted at your engine. However, your quite low rate of fire (~9 sec reload stock) will give your enemies a second, final blow.\n\n=== Mobility ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}\n<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->\n\n{{tankMobility|abMinHp=775|rbMinHp=442|AoAweight=0.15}}\n\nThe tank's mobility is impressive due to the very generous hp/ton ratio the engine provides to the medium tank. The wide track also helps with traction across softer ground, so the {{PAGENAME}} is less likely to be bogged down in more wet terrain like in the map [[Jungle]].\n\nExploit the {{PAGENAME}}'s mobility with its highly-angled hull armour to wreck havoc in the enemy lines by breaking through and marauding their controlled zones.\n\n=== Modifications and economy ===\n{{Specs-Economy}}\n\n== Armaments ==\n{{Specs-Tank-Armaments}}\n=== Main armament ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Weapon|1}}\n<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun. Assess its effectiveness in a battle based on the reloading speed, ballistics and the power of shells.

Add a link to the main article on the gun: <code><nowiki>{{main|Name of the weapon}}</nowiki></code>. Describe in general terms the ammunition available for the main gun. Give advice on how to use them and how to fill the ammunition storage.'' -->\n\nThe {{PAGENAME}}'s 76 mm F-34 is  overall better gun compared to the preceding L-11 gun, with much better armour-piercing characteristics, shell muzzle velocity, and faster reload time. The F-34 gun essentially makes the 76 mm-armed T-34 a menace in lower rank battles by being able to penetrate even heavy tanks with a well-placed hit.\n\nOf the three armour-piercing shells available, the two most recommended shells to bring to destroy enemy tanks is the APHEBC '''BR-350B (MD-8 fuze)''' and the APBC '''BR-350SP''' shells. Though the '''BR-350A (MD-5 fuze)''' has more explosive filler for post-penetration damage, the lower penetration values mean that this potential is useless if the shell can't penetrate the enemy tank's armour, hence the '''BR-350B''' is recommended for a balance in armour-piercing potential and post-penetration damage. The APBC presents the best penetration values, but does not have any explosive filler inside, so it is best to keep them in reserve in case the {{PAGENAME}} encounters one of the few troublesome vehicles it struggles to penetrate.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"100%\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" | [[F-34 (76 mm)|76 mm F-34]] || colspan=\"5\" | Turret rotation speed (°/s) || colspan=\"4\" | Reloading rate (seconds)\n|-\n!

The sloped armour, great acceleration with good speed and 76.2 mm cannon make it a force to be reckoned with especially against inexperienced players, meanwhile when facing experienced players, however, it can become scrap metal pretty fast. Compared to the [[T-34 (1940)|1940 version]], the 1941 gets a better 76.2 mm cannon which greatly improves the penetration power but still keeps the 1940 model turret. At distance, the sloped armour is efficient at blocking shells from enemy tanks with relatively short and small-calibre cannons even some long barrel and high calibre guns can also have trouble penetrating on the sloped armour if used well. Even with its sloped armour advantages, a T-34 is a relatively easy tank to knock out specifically with a well-placed shot. With the crew operating in a compact space around the turret, which is located in the centre of the tank where it is a very limited space to operate in makes it an easy tank to knock out the crew with a single blow from a shell with a good amount of high explosive filling. Also, be mindful of the T-34's turret. It is a weak spot and can be easily penetrated by an enemy shell and will with ease knock out the tank and its crew.\n\n;Urban Combat\n\nT-34's in urban combat are a lethal machine combined the sloped armour with its speed and manoeuvrability combined with the 76.2mm F-34 makes it excel in close-quarter combat against most enemy tanks it will face in battle. Its short barrel will do excellent against most enemy armour, with well-placed shots in close range battles. In urban (City) battles the T-34 is a great hit and run tank, offering great acceleration. At slow speed, it can also be highly lethal but advance with care. It takes a while for the barrel to stop shaking when going to halt from full speed, which is a drawback if directly facing an enemy tank, which can appear suddenly from around the street corners or sitting and covering other roads that exist in the city. It is recommended when advancing, use slow speed to reduce that shaking and which allows for better engagement to get that enemy to be knocked out.\n\n;Open Fields\n\nOpen fields are not the optimal combat situation for the T-34 1941 with its crew being relatively close to each other makes it prone to being a one-hit kill and an easy target for tanks like Pz IV F.2, StuG III F, Na-To and M10 GMC which can easily score a hit from far away. Utilize the acceleration, relative good speed and wide tracks to advance around on most terrain till a position where the gun can reliably penetrate enemy armour with a good well placed shot and knock the enemy threat out. Be aware of the surroundings there can be an enemy threat everywhere which can easily knock the T-34 from the side or a hit to the fragile turret.\n\n'''Common opponents''':\n\n* [[M4]], [[M4A2]] - The T-34's 76 mm gun cannot penetrate the welded hull M4/M4A2 reliably from the front, while the 75 mm gun on the M4/M4A2 can penetrate the T-34's turret and disable or cripple it. They do have very weak lower side hull armour (only 38 mm) that can be overmatched by the 76 mm APHEBC round if exposed, and the flat areas on the turret can also be penetrated fairly reliably if they can be hit. Generally avoid head-on engagements, especially if the M4 is hull-down.\n* [[M4A1]], [[Sherman II]] - Similar to the M4/M4A2, except that the cast hull is weaker than the welded hull on the M4/M4A2, and can be penetrated frontally. Otherwise, the same advice applies.\n* [[Pz.IV F2]], [[Pz.IV G|G]], [[Pz.IV H|H]], [[Pz.IV J|J]] - The Ausf. F2 variant is the first Panzer IV to mount a long-barreled 75 mm gun. This gun is one of the most lethal mounted on any tank within the T-34's BR range, and it is easily capable of penetrating the T-34 at most ranges. The Ausf. F2 has very weak armour, however, and is something of a glass cannon. The Ausf. G, H, and J have up-armoured hulls that are quite difficult to penetrate, but their turrets are as weak as the one on the F2. The Ausf. J, in particular, has manual turret traverse and is very vulnerable to being flanked. Avoid long-range duels with them.\n* [[Chi-Nu II]] - Essentially the Japanese counterpart to the German Panzer IV Ausf. F2.\n* [[Churchill III]], [[Pz.Kpfw. Churchill (Germany)]] - The 6-pounder gun on the Churchill will be hard-pressed to penetrate the sloped T-34 hull, but it can easily penetrate the turret and disable the turret crew. It is difficult to penetrate the frontal armour of the Churchill at long ranges. However, it is a slow, cumbersome heavy tank, and is easy to outflank and dispatch with shots to the side armour.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness.

Churchill (Germany)|Pz.Kpfw. Churchill]]\n* It is difficult to place bushes on the upper front hull due to the obstruction of MG port and driver's optics\n\n== History ==\n<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction.

This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->\n\n===Design===\nThe T-34 Model 1941 was the direct successor of the T-34 Model 1940. It featured the exact same design, with a frontal sloped armour, a 2-man turret, a 500 HP engine and a 76 mm gun.\n\n===Development===\nOnly minor modifications were implemented in the T-34 Model 1941. The main goal was to get rid of teething problems and improve manufacturability. It still had a cramped 2-man turret but it was better armoured: the vehicle gained 2 tons overall. It received a better radio equipment for commander tanks but the turret lost its periscope. It kept the initial engine but received better injection, air filter and a better gear box. A major change was the better 76 mm F-34 gun. The gun featuring a better performance was installed on new T-34 Model 1941 in place of the 76 mm L-11 at the initiative of Vasiliy Grabin. Those new tanks were then issued to platoon commanders who in return praised the new gun for its performance. This led the Soviet bureaucratic institutions to approve the gun for production and integration on The T-34. Production started early 1941 in Kharkov. While only 400 T-34 Model 1940 were produced. a total of 3,111 T-34 Model 1941 were produced by Soviet factories before switching to the Model 1942.\n\n===Combat usage===\nThe T-34 (1941) was the first T-34 to massively see combat. It was deployed on the Eastern front to counter the advance of German armour and was deemed a performant platform by Soviet troops. The lack of effectiveness of German 50 mm guns against the sloped armour of T-34s led to the development of new 75 and 88 mm guns to equip German tanks.\n\n=== In-game description ===\nThe second T-34 model was developed in 1941. The main difference in the T-34 Mod. 1941 was the installation of the new 76 mm F-34 cannon with a 41.5 calibre barrel length. In addition, the shape of the cannon's recoil mechanism armour was changed, along with the method used to attach it. The muzzle velocity of its armour-piercing shell was somewhat higher than that of the L-11 cannon, amounting to 662 m/s. The weapon's armour penetration and gun depression were increased. Its practical rate of fire in combat conditions came to 3-5 shots per minute. Apart from that, the Mod. 1941 tanks were equipped with tracks with more pronounced track grousers.\n\nIn 1942, versions appeared with cast turrets and new, wider tracks. Shortages of rubber deliveries for manufacturing road wheel bands forced the development of fully metallic wheels. Throughout 1942, an attempt was made to strengthen the tank's armour by laying additional 20-25 mm plates in the turret and frontal hull. The final issue tanks had additional fuel tanks attached to the back of the hull, along with a large number of hand-rails on the turret and hull for ease of carrying tankborne infantry and servicing the vehicle's components.\n\nAll in all, a large number of changes were aimed first and foremost at simplifying production and increasing the T-34's manufacturing speed. Some of these tanks were equipped with ATO-41 flamethrowers. In 1943, a design was presented at factory No. 112 to improve the T-34's armour after the fashion of German tanks. Vehicles with reinforced turrets, hull and side add-on armour were tested on the front in August 1943. Tests in combat conditions showed that the tank's survivability had not significantly increased, so the design was discarded.\n\nSetting up production in evacuated factories allowed the number of these vehicles in tank units to be significantly increased, and from 1942, the T-34 became the most prolific tank, with more produced than all other types of tanks combined.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=ussr_t_34_1941 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|XorVHprN6f8|'''The T-34 Family'''  - ''War Thunder Official Channel'' discusses the {{PAGENAME}} at 03:28.|u-_8noqc5zE|'''T-34 1941 Tank Review''' - ''NUSensei''}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n;Related development\n* [[T-34 (Family)]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [http://www.wardrawings.be/WW2/Files/1-Vehicles/Allies/2-USSR/03-MediumTanks/T-34(76)/File/4-Models.htm <nowiki>[War Drawings]</nowiki> T-34/76 Variants (French)] ([https://web.archive.org/web/20210422190418/http://www.wardrawings.be/WW2/Files/1-Vehicles/Allies/2-USSR/03-MediumTanks/T-34(76)/File/4-Models.htm Web Archive])\n\n{{TankManufacturer Morozov}}\n{{USSR medium tanks}}"}}
