Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium gift rank {{Specs|rank}} Soviet medium tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced as a premium pack in June 2014 during [[Update 1.41]]. and was removed from the Gaijin store in [https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/336443-shop-clearance-sale-in-the-store-50-discount October 2016]. It was also available in the Steam store from June 2014 to August 2018, when it was removed to become a reward for the [[wt:en/news/5650-marathon-operation-s-u-m-m-e-r-assemble-a-tank-updated-en|2018 \"Operation S.U.M.M.E.R.\"]] crafting event.\n\nThe feature of this tank is its 16 mm of spaced armour around its turret and sides, which in some occasions will bounce incoming shells when angled correctly. The T-34E is a truly unique tank for the collector, and also very useful often outperforming other T-34s. The extra spaced armour can be truly life-saving in certain situations.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->\n\n'''Armour type:'''\n\n* Rolled homogeneous armour (hull, turret rear, turret roof, gun mantlet)\n* Cast homogeneous armour (turret flanks, glacis joint, driver's hatch, machine gun port)\n* High hardness rolled homogeneous armour (side skirts, sides and turret spaced armour)\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

While angling, the upper frontal plate will also be unlikely for a shell to penetrate, therefore only exposing the turret.\n\nThe {{PAGENAME}} suffers from its weak turret like other early T-34s do. Even with the spaced armour, the {{PAGENAME}} still cannot stop most other enemy shells. So during engagements, try not to expose your turret by hiding behind an object. Also, when the {{PAGENAME}} is not angled, the upper frontal plate is very weak since there is no spaced armour there. So to minimize the chance to expose the weak spots, you should angle the tank 45 degrees to bounce incoming shells.\n\nWhen getting hit by an enemy, some shells can penetrate the tank, and depending on the type of shells and the type of gun, the result may be very different. Against cannons larger than 75 mm, the {{PAGENAME}}'s interior will be decimated. However, you will have a good chance to survive shells that are smaller with AP (Armour-Piercing) related shells. When suffering damage, most times your gunner and loader will be knocked out, or sometimes the cannon breech will be damaged. Therefore you should train your crew with high repair and agility skills.\n\n=== Mobility ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}\n<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->\n\n{{tankMobility|abMinHp=775|rbMinHp=442}}\n\nThe {{PAGENAME}} has a decent top speed of 42 km/h, it is slightly slower than its other twins [[T-34 (1940)]] and [[T-34 (1941)|(1941)]] because of the extra weight of the spaced armour. With this speed, you will be able to reach certain positions before other medium tank counterparts. To use this speed to the fullest, players are suggested to flank around the map and get side shots of enemies. The reverse speed of the {{PAGENAME}} is mediocre, which means that players should not attempt to overextend when attacking, or this often results in destruction.\n\n=== Modifications and economy ===\n{{Specs-Economy}}\n\n== Armaments ==\n{{Specs-Tank-Armaments}}\n=== Main armament ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Weapon|1}}\n<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun.

Give advice on how to use them and how to fill the ammunition storage.'' -->\n{{main|F-34 (76 mm)}}\n\nThe gun on T-34E is the same on [[T-34 (1941)]] and [[T-34 (1942)|(1942)]], the F-34 cannon is a decent gun at this battle rating and offers a large number of different shells. All of the shells are useful in their own ways, but most players prefer using BR-350B, this is because of its performance in combat. BR-350B is classified as an APHEBC shell, which means that once the shell enters a tank, in most situations, it will explode and destroy the enemy at once. The reloading speed is average compared to other tanks in this tier, so you should avoid blind shooting just in case.\n\nLike many other T-34s, the amount of ammunition does not affect combat by much, because of the location of the ammo rack. The ammo rack is located under the loader and the gunner, which is an unlikely place for one to shoot.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"100%\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" | [[F-34 (76 mm)|76 mm F-34]] || colspan=\"5\" | Turret rotation speed (°/s) || colspan=\"4\" | Reloading rate (seconds)\n|-\n!

During the movement, only the Dzherzhinski Tractor Factory in Stalingrad (STZ) stayed in production and produced most of the T-34s during the relocation.\n\nTo increase the survivability of the tanks, the T-34 design in the STZ factory was up-armoured by use of applique armour plates. These applique armour variants of the T-34 were called '''T-34E''', with \"E\" meaning \"ekranami\" translates to \"with screens\" in Russian. These tanks were given applique armour throughout the entire vehicle, on all sides of the turret, one the front, on the sides, and even side skirts on the tracks. Some of the applique armour was placed in a way to act as spaced armour against enemy fire, which proved quite effective against the [[Pz.III L|Panzer III]]'s 50 mm KwK 39 cannon where the armour applied were on areas once vulnerable on the T-34 to the cannon. However, it was found that this additional armour did not help the T-34 against larger calibres such as the 75 mm PaK 40 and the 88 mm FlaK cannons. Due to the gradually growing number of tanks with the 75 mm and 88 mm, such as the up-gunned [[Pz.IV F2|Panzer IV]] and the [[Tiger H1|Tiger I]] that could easily destroy the T-34 even with the armour application, the armour configuration was not placed into mass production and thus only the testing batch of 47 units were made from the design.\nHowever, one armour applique model produced in STZ did see more widespread use in the production line, though it still had the name '''T-34E''' as its main nomenclature (also called the [[T-34E STZ]] in-game). This up-armoured model was more successful than the previous due to not drastically changing the design and only focusing on front armour protection by welding 15 mm of armour onto the front hull, thus minimizing weight gain by only focusing on the area most expected to be hit. The tank also featured redesigned road wheels and track designs. These T-34Es saw more widespread use and have photographs showing it being used in the Leningrad Front.\n\n=== In-game description ===\nUp-armoured T-34 tanks were produced between the autumn of 1941 and the spring of 1942 at the STZ factory. In total, 3,644 of them were made. The vehicles' frontal hull armour was increased to 60 mm thickness and their frontal turret armour to 75 mm thickness. This was achieved by welding on add-on armour plates. A key character of these tanks was their fully metallic road wheels with radial hole patterns in the wheel disc. Such wheels were necessary due to a shortage of rubber for road wheel bands. The tank's idler wheels were also fully metallic. The turret's rear panel was fully welded, while its upper and side panels were held together by joints. The front of the turret featured characteristic lateral slots, while the cannon's recoil mechanisms were armoured with a straight frontal piece.\n\nThe up-armoured T-34E tanks were used in battle from the summer of 1942 to the beginning of 1944. Some captured vehicles of this type were used by Wehrmacht troops in 1942-1943. These had both the standard 4BO green with Wehrmacht identifying markings and the camouflage used by German forces.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=ussr_t_34E Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Images\n<gallery mode=\"packed-hover\">\nImage:T-34E Bicolor summer camouflage.jpg|<small>T-34E Bicolor summer camouflage</small>\n</gallery>\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|UKpMOtGXBcg|'''T-34E Tank Review'''  - ''NUSensei''|LbTcvQmfL70|'''{{PAGENAME}}, Russian, Tier-2 Premium Medium Tank''' - ''Angry Nerd Gaming''}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n;Other uparmoured vehicles of the same family\n\n* [[T-34E STZ]]\n* [[T 34 747 (r) (Germany)]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wt:en/news/5650-marathon-operation-s-u-m-m-e-r-assemble-a-tank-updated-en|[Marathon] Operation S.U.M.M.E.R.: Assemble a tank!]]\n\n{{TankManufacturer Morozov}}\n\n{{USSR medium tanks}}\n{{USSR premium ground vehicles}}"}}
