In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium rank {{Specs|rank}} Soviet medium tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.55 \"Royal Armour\"]]. It has the same design as the standard [[T-44]], but comes with a [[D-25T (122 mm)|122 mm gun]] instead, giving the tank a very high boost in firepower compared to its previous [[ZIS-S-53 (85 mm)|85 mm cannon]].\n\nThe most distinctive feature of the T-44-122 is its excellent 122 mm cannon. This cannon has the ability to reliably penetrate the front of every single tank at 6.3 except for the [[T28]]. However, this does come at the cost of a long reload which can be somewhat assuaged with an upgraded crew (max reload ~23sec).\n\nSuccinctly put, the T-44-122 is a go-kart equipped with a 122 mm gun. At its BR, it is highly competitive with its peers, sporting an extremely powerful 122 mm cannon, Panther-like armour, and Hellcat-like manoeuvrability. As such, the T-44-122 makes for an excellent flanking tank due to its high mobility and devastating firepower. A single 122 mm to the side of an enemy tank can instantly destroy it. When flanking, try to stay out of reach from the enemy's cannon as the 122 mm has a long reload and the T-44-122 will be vulnerable in this time period from enemies with cannons like the [[KwK 43 (88 mm)|88 mm]] on the [[Tiger II (H)|Tiger II]] and possible flankers.\n\nIn urban combat, the T-44-122 both excels and suffers due to its 122 mm cannon. On one hand, the sheer firepower of the cannon makes for an excellent tank destroying machine; on the other, the long reload make it difficult to deal with multiple opponents. Playing with a teammate is highly recommended.\n\nAdditionally, the 122 mm cannon also makes the T-44-122 a somewhat good sniper, but this nullifies the excellent mobility which should be utilized on the battlefield.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection.

The T-44-122 plays almost identically to the -85 variant T-34/44s, but obviously gets the added bonus of being able to penetrate most vehicles frontally in an emergency.\n\nMost ~6.3 British vehicles with stabilizers (etc. [[FV4202]]) are extremely dangerous as they have APDS/AP that can shear through the T-44's armour like butter. Additionally, the [[Tiger II (H)]] can only be penetrated through the turret but thankfully such a target is much less mobile than the aforementioned vehicles and also lacks a stabilizer.\n[[File:Wsp volumetric shell diagram.png|thumb|Differences between non-volumetric shells and volumetric shells hitting a Tiger I]]\nAn important note when engaging tanks, especially Tiger Is, is that, with the implementation of volumetric shells, you can no longer expect your shells to pierce through small openings or right past an obstacle. The large 122 mm calibre of your shells will result in it catching on an armour plate's edge very often, losing all of its penetration. For example, a Tiger I has some edges that can absorb your shell unexpectedly, despite having flat armour. Thus you must always make sure that where you are aiming at is absolutely free of obstruction, or it may result in a non-penetration or a ricochet. This can be seen in the diagram to the right.\n\n==== Specific Enemies Worth Noting ====\nThese are common vehicles you will see in this tank:\n\n* ☠ [[T32]] - You have to go for the MG port in the lower left of the UFP, otherwise you can only penetrate the side armour or the rear.\n* ☠ [[T28]] - You can only penetrate the cupolas on top of the tank. If they're hidden or you are unsure about the shot, you can try hitting the cannon barrel and running away.\n* ☠ [[Ferdinand]] - Go for the angled armour at the sides of the lower front plate (below the casemate, but above the lowest plates), this will disable Ferdinand's engine and/or driver, so you can flank and finish it off.\n* ☠ [[Jagdtiger]] - You cannot reliably penetrate or damage this tank frontally. You can try disabling the cannon barrel, and then flanking is your best option (or running away).\n* ☠ [[Conqueror]] - Shoot the hull, don't shoot the turret.\n* ☠ [[Ho-Ri Production]] - You cannot reliably penetrate or damage this tank frontally. You can try disabling the cannon barrel and then flanking is your best option (or running).\n* ☠ [[AMX-50 Foch]] - You cannot reliably penetrate or damage this tank frontally. You can try disabling the cannon barrel and then flanking is your best option (or running).\n* [[T34]] / [[T29]] - Turret cheeks can work, although it's best to go for the LFP because the ammo storage is very low in the tank. If you don't see the LFP, try going just below the turret ring, where the driver sits.\n* [[Tiger II (H)]] / [[Panther II]] - You can easily penetrate the turret cheeks with BR-471B.\n* [[Panther tank (Family)|Panther]] [[Panther D|D]], [[Panther A|A]], [[Panther G|G]], [[Panther F|F]] - You can penetrate the UFP\n* [[Tortoise]] - Shoot to the right of the gun of the Tortoise, when you see it head-on if shoot on the left plate there is a chance to knock it out with a single shot.\n* [[AMX-50 Surbaissé]] - Go for the LFP.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness.

Can cut through the upper front plate of the Panther at ranges excess of 500 m\n* About the same size as many light tanks at the rank, meaning this tank is fairly easy to conceal\n* Ridiculous mobility and top speed. Can keep up with nearly every light tank in the game\n* Unlike many Soviet tanks having only 3 degrees of gun depression, this tank has 5 degrees. Hull down fighting and hill fighting is a lot easier to preform\n* The armour is decent. Can effectively side scrape\n* This tank is both a fantastic flanker/ambushing tank\n\n'''Cons:'''\n\n* Can only carry 24 shells into battle\n* Even with an ACE crew, the gun has a horrifying reload speed of 23 seconds\n* 5 degrees of gun depression still isn't very good\n* Worse upper plate armour than any other T44\n* Slow reverse speed\n* Unlike the other T44s, this tank has such a bad reload speed means that brawling is not advised\n* Getting jumped by two or more tanks is almost certain death thanks to the guns terrible reload speed\n\n== History ==\n<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction.

The mobility of the [[T-34-85|T-34]] medium tank was to be similar, but with more armour on it. In November, chief designer A. A. Morozov presented a design and model, and it was designated the '''[[T-44]]''' (Object 136). The first prototype was completed on January the next year and two more in February. The first two prototypes are armed with the 85 mm D-5T gun with the designation T-44-85, while the last had a 122 mm D-25-44T cannon similar to the one on the [[IS-2]] tank (Though differing from one-piece ammunition and better muzzle brake) designated the [[T-44-122]]. An innovative feature that allowed the mounting of heavy guns on a 30-ton design was the placement of the engine perpendicular to the axis of the tank. This allowed the hull to be made without sponsons, gave the crew a much bigger fighting compartment, had the turret placed on the centre of the vehicle and reduced the vehicle's overall length. However, the ammo stored on the left side of the tank was easily hit and could detonate, destroying the tank. The armour on the design featured 75 mm thick plate on the front, 90 mm on the turret mantlet, side armour is 45 mm thick with the capability of mounting an additional 30 mm of armour. These prototypes had a V-2IS diesel engine delivering 500 horsepower. The tank provided many advantages over the T-34 design, the gun accuracy on the T-44 design was arguably better, and the turret ring was more reliable. It presented more than double frontal armour without significantly affecting weight distribution. The increased fighting compartment meant that the turret floor ammunition storage on the T-34 could be removed. Tank height comparison, the T-44 was 300 mm lower than the T-34, and the driver's vision from his hatch is much better than on the T-34.\n\n===Testing and cancellation===\nTrials with the first prototypes began in February 1944. One of the competition was against the German [[Panther G|Panther tank]]. Compared to the T-44-85, the T-44-122 was flawed and unsatisfactory. The large gun made the interiors cramped and unable for the crew inside to work properly. The rate of fire with the 122 mm, even when using single-piece ammunition, was very slow with a maximum of only three rounds per minute. This compounded with the fact that the T-44-122 could only hold 24 rounds inside the tank, makes the T-44 with the 122 mm gun unsatisfactory for the role of a medium tank. Thus, all further development on the 122 mm armed T-44 is cancelled for further development on the 85 mm variant, which continued on to finally being accepted into service on November 1944 and with 1,823 units built from 1944 to 1947.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=ussr_t_44_122 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Images\n<gallery mode=\"packed-hover\"  heights=\"200\">\nT-44-122 and Panther.JPG|<small>The T-44-122 prototype on trials alongside a German [[Panther D|Panther]]</small>\n</gallery>\n\n== See also ==\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.''\n\n{{TankManufacturer Morozov}}\n{{USSR medium tanks}}\n{{USSR premium ground vehicles}}"}}
