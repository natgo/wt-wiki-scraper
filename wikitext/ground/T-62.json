In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Soviet medium tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.61 \"Road to Glory\"]]. The T-62 is a further development of the T-54 series and was made to fight the newer NATO tanks. It features a [[U-5TS_(115_mm)|115 mm U-5TS smoothbore gun]], which makes the T-62 the first tank in-game and in real life to use a smoothbore gun. The gun also was the first to introduce the Armour-piercing fin-stabilized discarding sabot (APFSDS) into the game.\n\nIn the 1950s, with the introduction of the [[L7A1 (105 mm)|105 mm L7 tank gun]] on many NATO tanks such as the [[Centurion Mk 10|Centurion]], [[Leopard I|Leopard]], and [[M60]], the Soviets realised that the 100 mm D-10 on the [[T-54 (1951)|T-54]]/[[T-55A|T-55]] series of medium tanks was becoming obsolete. To maintain parity with the new NATO tanks, a new 115 mm smoothbore gun was developed along with a new medium tank based on the T-55. This tank entered service in 1961 as the T-62 and was the first tank in the world to begin service with a smoothbore gun.\n\nWhile there is little improvement in terms of mobility or protection over the previous [[T-54 (1951)|T-54]], the T-62 has substantially improved firepower. It is capable of frontally penetrating nearly any tank it is likely to see in-game at most combat ranges.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->\n\nThe armour protection of the T-62 is very similar to that of the [[T-54 (1951)|T-54]]. Unfortunately, the T-62 tends to face more powerful guns at its BR, so its armour is not nearly as effective for its BR as the T-54's is. The well-rounded turret and sloped hull can ricochet poorly aimed rounds when angled, but should not be relied upon to protect the T-62.\n\nLike most Soviet tanks, the T-62 has a very compact layout, meaning that a single penetrating hit is will most likely cripple or outright destroy the tank. Of particular note of concern is the front hull ammunition rack inside the fuel tank situated next to the driver. This rack is the ready rack of the T-62 and cannot be emptied by reducing the number of rounds carried. A penetrating hit there is likely to result in an ammunition cook-off that will instantly destroy the tank.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Armour\n!Front (Slope angle)\n!Sides\n!Rear\n!Roof\n|-\n|Hull\n|100 mm (59°) + 30 mm (59°) ''Upper glacis + add-on RHA''\n100 mm (50-51°) ''Lower glacis''\n|80 mm (0°) ''Middle to upper side''\n80 mm (20-61°) ''Turret ring extension''\n20 mm (0-28°) ''Lower hull side''\n8 mm (0°) ''Side Skirts''\n|45 mm (0-2°) ''All rear''\n|30 mm (87°) ''Hull roof incl. engine deck''\n|-\n|Turret\n|240-214 mm (14-60°) + 85-65 (7-33°) ''Turret cheeks + add-on RHA''\n40-50 mm (0-63°) ''Mantlet''\n40 mm ''Rear Mantlet Plate''\n|165-140 mm (16-57°) ''Turret side''\n|65 mm (3-26°) ''Turret rear''\n|60 mm (74-78°) ''Forehead Armour''\n30 mm (78-85°) ''Turret roof''\n60 mm (29-67°) ''Rear turret roof (including ejection port)''\n|}\n=== Mobility ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}\n<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->\n\n{{tankMobility|abMinHp= 899|rbMinHp= 513}}\n\nThe {{PAGENAME}}'s mobility is somewhat similar to that of the T-54 medium tank, although the heavier weight makes it a little bit more sluggish. It can reach a respectable 50 km/h forward, and the maximum reverse speed is -8 km/h. Because the {{PAGENAME}} is longer than the T-54 and does not have neutral steering, its turning performance is noticeably worse, especially on rough terrain.\n\n=== Modifications and economy ===\n{{Specs-Economy}}\n\n== Armaments ==\n{{Specs-Tank-Armaments}}\n=== Main armament ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Weapon|1}}\n<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun.

It is stabilised, allowing for accurate firing on the move. The turret traverse is also significantly improved over that of the [[T-54 (1951)|T-54]], and the turret also provides more gun depression, allowing for some use of hull-down tactics. It should be noted that the gun has limited depression when the gun passes over the hull fuel tanks (at roughly 45 degrees to each side). Due to the large size of the 115 mm ammunition and cramped space of the T-62, the reload is much slower than that of comparable NATO tanks (~10–12 s depending on crew skill level and training).\n\n==== Ammunition ====\nWhile the APFSDS ammunition is not as lethal as the APHE ammunition used on previous Soviet medium tanks and requires some degree of careful aim, it is still capable of destroying tanks in one shot, especially with frontal penetrations.\n\n* There are two types of APFSDS ammunition: 3BM3 and 3BM4. The stock 3BM4 round has a pure steel kinetic rod while the unlockable 3BM3 dart is a steel rod with a tungsten slug inside the penetrator. The latter has substantially more vertical penetration and somewhat better post-penetration lethality, but its performance against highly sloped armour is significantly worse. Both rounds have outstanding muzzle velocities of over 1,600 m/s, allowing long-range shots to be made without much lead.\n\n* The 3BK4 fin-stabilised HEAT round has more penetration than either APFSDS round and retains its penetration at long ranges, but has a much slower muzzle velocity that makes aiming at long ranges significantly more difficult. It is more effective than APFSDS against lightly armoured targets since it can reliably hull-break them if it detonates.\n\n* The 3OF11 fin-stabilised HE round is rather unremarkable and is only really useful against soft targets.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"100%\"\n! colspan=\"8\" | Penetration statistics\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" data-sort-type=\"text\" | Ammunition\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Type of<br>warhead\n! colspan=\"6\" | Penetration @ 0° Angle of Attack (mm)\n|-\n! 10 m !! 100 m !! 500 m !! 1,000 m !! 1,500 m !! 2,000 m\n|-\n| 3BM4 || APFSDS || 285 || 279 || 263 || 243 || 222 || 202\n|-\n| 3BM3 || APFSDS || 350 || 347 || 322 || 300 || 283 || 270\n|-\n| 3BK4 || HEATFS || 440 || 440 || 440 || 440 || 440 || 440\n|-\n| 3OF11 || HE || 31 || 31 || 31 || 31 || 31 || 31\n|-\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"100%\"\n! colspan=\"10\" | Shell details\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" data-sort-type=\"text\" | Ammunition\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Type of<br>warhead\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Velocity<br>(m/s)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Projectile<br>Mass (kg)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Fuse delay<br>(m)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Fuse sensitivity<br>(mm)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Explosive Mass<br>(TNT equivalent) (g)\n! colspan=\"3\" | Ricochet\n|-\n! 0% !! 50% !! 100%\n|-\n| 3BM4 || APFSDS || 1,615 || 4 || N/A || N/A || N/A || 72° || 76° || 78°\n|-\n| 3BM3 || APFSDS || 1,615 || 4 || N/A || N/A || N/A || 76° || 77° || 80°\n|-\n| 3BK4 || HEATFS || 950 || 12.97 || 0.05 || 0.1 || 2,280 || 65° || 72° || 77°\n|-\n| 3OF11 || HE || 905 || 14.86 || 0 || 0.1 || 2,640 || 79° || 80° || 81°\n|-\n|}\n\n==== [[Ammo racks]] ====\n[[File:Ammoracks_{{PAGENAME}}.png|right|thumb|x250px|[[Ammo racks]] of the {{PAGENAME}}]]\n<!-- '''Last updated: 2.13.0.180''' -->\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!

As usual with soviet MBTs, only the turret has armour to speak of. Do not let this put you off as the T-62's 115mm U-5TS is able to perform exceptionally even with 10.0 BR tanks. In fact, the U-5TS has more penetration than what comes after it, the T-55A, making a lot of players fall back to it (not to mention you lose the cool shell dump animation!). This comes at the cost of slightly slower reload time of 12.0s (9.2s if maxed crew), which is a little below average for its BR. All in all, the T-62 will give Soviet Tankers a general idea of how to play upcoming MBTs, as the playstyle doesn't change much.\n\nIt is best to find visual cover as soon as possible if an enemy plane was spotted since the tank does not have a top machine gun to protect itself from aircraft.\n\n=== General Playstyle ===\nIt is recommended to play Arcade through the stock grind of the T-62, because your mobility is automatically improved, and the aiming reticle in Arcade will help you penetrate vehicles with the poorer stock round. However, this tank does excel in Realistic, because it can make use of its lower silhouette and very accurate gun (long-range encounters are much easier because there is very little bullet drop).\n\n==== <u>Arcade Battles</u> ====\nThe T-62 performs rather well in Arcade, due to a very good gun and a mobile platform. Its armour does help you survive from time to time, especially when you are hidden behind bushes or buildings, and the enemies have to go off of your red silhouette to aim (ricochets are plenty in this scenario, because of the circular turret), however, you shouldn't rely on the armour. The biggest downside of playing Arcade is the fact that you have to face Soviet vehicles, which have the most armour around tier you will be fighting and can be annoying to fight.\n\nIn Arcade, it's advised to go to sniping positions at the beginning of the match, and later move closer to the objectives to aid your team with clean-up or with a counter-push to secure objectives. Now, due to the small sizes of maps in Arcade, it sometimes works to drive straight into the open and try to hit an enemy exiting their spawn (something that is easy to do with the stabilizer and is a great way to get the \"First Blow!\" award). If not possible, then it's advised to go to one side of the map and occupy a sniping position (e.g. the hills on the Middle East, South spawn; or the rocks overlooking the sands of El Alamein, either spawn; or rocks around Alaska, either spawn; etc.).\n\n'''''Important Note:''''' If more than half of your team is sniping, as often happens on disliked maps such as the Middle East, step up to the plate and go for the objectives. For details on city combat read-on.\n\nThe T-62 can fight in close quarters in Arcade very well. However, caution needs to be taken, because the reload is sub-par, and it generally doesn't allow you to push further than the objectives, because you get overrun with enemies just spawning in. So, if you find yourself in close quarters, decide if your team can cover you from the sides: if they look like they can, then focus forwards - take a strategic position where you overlook a passage to the objective and wait for enemies to pass through and shoot them; if your team can't cover you from the sides, then be very careful about your actions - it's best to find some cover in-front of your tank, and look around your sides, because when enemies don't encounter enemies, they will push up and show you their sides.\n\n''However'', this doesn't mean that you should always rely on your team, or you should always stick to a single location. Arcade allows you to move around and to succeed, you must move around, because it is difficult for opponents to know where exactly you can shoot them from if you constantly change your angles. So you should find a piece of cover, snipe a couple of tanks, then move forwards or sideways across the map to another position and surprise other enemies.\n\n'''''Important Note:''''' Try to keep an eye on the minimap and have a general idea where large groups of enemies are - you don't want to run into 3 leopards in a city by accident. Keeping general enemy locations in mind will help you with your advancement plans - you shouldn't rush around the map only ''hoping'' that you won't get shot.\n\n==== <u>Realistic Battles</u> ====\nThe T-62 enjoys Realistic Battles because its low silhouette can surprise enemies. It can hide behind a small bush, and hold an ambush position overlooking an open area around an objective (e.g. around the city in Alaska, or in the forests on European Province). The low silhouette and the amazing gun should be used together to ambush enemies at any range, one-shot them and then change position so that any call-outs on the enemy team are wrong information by the time they are noticed. It can be rather annoying playing Realistic in this tank, however, due to German and Italian tanks being able to get half-way across the map and set-up ambushes before you are able to leave your spawn (this is negated in Arcade, because it's always mixed battles and faster tanks get killed first by faster enemy tanks).\n\nIn Realistic, long-range encounters are plenty, and they do favour the T-62, unless in a rather hilly environment, where the gun depression isn't enough. It is recommended to get into some sniping position at the start of the match, but after 3-5 shots to attempt to move forward, closer to the objectives. At that point, all of the Leopards and Centauros should be moving forward to your spawn, and while they are doing so, you can usually pick them off one-by-one (the is very effective if you've managed to move close to the objectives, because you will be in the enemy's rear as they move past the objectives).\n\n'''''Side-Note:''''' If you see a teammate pushing in the same direction you are, then follow them, but stay some distance behind. Chances are if there are enemy ambushes, they are going to fire at your teammate and you will in turn be able to disable or destroy the ambushers.\n\nThere is less close quarters encounters in Realistic Battles, however many objectives are placed inside towns or cities. In those cases, when playing the T-62 it's important to surprise the enemy, so it's advised to go on a big flank. If you know where the enemies are, approximately, you may get away with simply rushing them, because they won't expect it, however, this poses a big risk and should only be done in dire situations. If you do find yourself in a stand-off with another tank, you can try baiting a shot by showing them your front plate while angling it (but not showing the side), by using a corner of a building as cover. You can also abandon the encounter, retreat, find an ambush and wait, although a smart enemy will be cautious, some might fall into your trap.\n\n'''''Important Note:''''' Soviet vehicles such as the Object 906 or the BMP-2 are better equipped for close-quarters, so if you're planning on fighting in cities, they are the better choice.\n\n=== The Stock Grind ===\nThrough experience, it has been found best to complete the first part of the stock grind in Arcade Battles, notably '''researching Parts and FPE''' and perhaps Adjustment of Fire. Arcade is better due to the fact that the maps are smaller and you are almost guaranteed to get one kill. Moreover, '''you can activate 3-5 spare universal back-ups''' and spawn twice in the T-62 in the next 3-5 battles.\n\nHowever you decide to complete the stock grind, these are some general tips:\n\n* Stay further back and play passive - your reload will be your death as soon as you find yourself too far in front of your team.\n** As a part of this strategy, you can bait teammates by letting them go first and see where they are shot from, then shooting those enemies.\n** You can also just snipe, because your rounds are insanely fast from the beginning, and it's easy to hit long shots.\n* Play the objectives, because it increases the chances of your team winning, and also gives you research points.\n** Moreover, enemies converge on objectives, especially light tanks, which are easy to take out.\n* It's always a good idea to stick close to your squadmate, or a light tank because they are able to repair you even if you can't.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as \"bad\", \"good\" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as \"inadequate\" and \"effective\".'' -->\n\n'''Pros:'''\n\n* Good stock grind due to default shell being the 3BM4 which has enough flat pen and a great amount of angled pen to lay waste on any adversaries at this BR\n* Better gun depression in comparison to most Soviet tanks before which allows it to utilize some hull down tactics in some situations.\n* Faster turret traverse than the T-54/T-55A\n* Larger ammunition capacity than the T-54, with a generous hull ready rack\n* Easy to learn and play\n* ESS smoke system which can create a massive smokescreen for your team as well as allowing you to cover up your retreat\n* Has a stabilizer which improves its fire-on-the move capabilities and aids in getting the first shot against enemies, especially against those without stabilizers\n* Relatively low profile\n\n'''Cons:'''\n\n* No anti-aircraft heavy machine gun which makes dealing with aircraft as well as lightly armoured vehicles more difficult\n* \"Upgraded\" 3BM3 round while having more flat penetration is worse than the stock 3BM4 round due to having significantly worse angled penetration.The increased flat pen of 3BM3 is not really needed at this battle rating due most enemies having weak armour (such as Leopards) and many tanks relying more on sloped armour for protection (such as T95E1 and Chieftains)\n* Turret traverse is still slower than other tanks\n* Gun depression is still bad, can be easily exploited by experienced players\n* Slow reload compared to NATO 105 mm L7-armed main battle tanks\n* ESS is located on the left side of the tank\n* Not as mobile as the T-54/55A\n* No neutral steering\n* Lack of APHE shells compared to earlier Soviet tanks can feel like a letdown for knocking out tanks with a single shot\n* Cramped layout prone to vulnerable crippling hits or ammunition detonation when penetrated\n\n== History ==\n<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction.

It was the first Soviet tank to utilize a smoothbore cannon. After the successful prototyping and service of the T-54 and T-55, the Soviet MoD looked forward to improve the tanks by the end of the '50s. The T-62 was born of the of Object 430, a prototype from the T-54 which was heavily modified, mainly turret armour shape and thickness, increasing armour from 185 mm to 240 mm proportional to the turret's shape. It featured an improved version of the the T-55A D-10TS, the D-54TS. This project was designated officially as T-54M but was abandoned after prototype stages. Later, on the late 1950's, Uralvagonzavod built the Object 140, featuring the exact same hull but with a 6 road wheel suspension, same turret and gun. Prototype stages shown the unreliability of said vehicle due to the maintenance and expensive systems. Forced to abandon it, in 1958, Uralvagonzavod opted on modernizing the turret of the Object 140 fitting it with a case ejector and mounting it on a T-55 chassis. Due to the increased weight and proportion of the turret, a suspension redisign was inevitable. This prototype was designated Object 165 which was later set on trials in November 1958. It was accepted and serviced in 1962 under the name of T-62A. Later on the year, Uralvagonzavod opted to recalibre the D-45TS 100 mm gun in order to become a greater threat. It featured an increase in calibre from 100 mm to 115 mm, removal of rifling, increase in length, removal of muzzle break and adding of a bore evacuator at the middle of the gun and addition of an automatic case ejector. This gun was designated U-5TS.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=ussr_t_62 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Images\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"150\">\nFile:T-62 WTWallpaper 01.jpg|\nFile:T-62 WTWallpaper 02.jpg|\nFile:T-62 WTWallpaper 03.jpg|\nFile:T-62 WTWallpaper 04.jpg|\nFile:T-62 WTWallpaper 05.jpg|\n</gallery>\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|UJgwa8GECEo|'''{{PAGENAME}} Tank Review''' - ''NUSensei''|KUSnuNXASxE|'''Most produced tanks''' discusses the {{PAGENAME}} at 1:18 - ''War Thunder Official Channel''|ORTP3a7fErM|'''Tank Chat #107 - T-62''' - ''The Tank Museum''|a__ks1GgJRU|'''All the Guns on a T-62 Tank''' (with Nicholas Moran, the Chieftain) - ''Forgotten Weapons''}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n;Vehicles equipped with the same chassis\n\n* [[T-62 545 (China)]]\n* [[T-62M-1]]\n* [[IT-1]]\n\n;Other vehicles of similar configuration and role\n\n* [[T-54/55 (Family)]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wt:en/news/4160-development-t-62-in-keeping-with-tradition-en|[Devblog] T-62 In Keeping With Tradition]]\n* [[wikipedia:T-62|[Wikipedia] T-62]]\n* [https://tanks-encyclopedia.com/coldwar/USSR/soviet_T-62.php <nowiki>[Tanks Encyclopedia]</nowiki> T-62]\n\n{{USSR medium tanks}}"}}
