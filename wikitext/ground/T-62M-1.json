In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Soviet medium tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.79 \"Project X\"]].\n\nA modernized version of the famous [[T-62]], the T-62M-1 chiefly features improved firepower, fire control, and protection in a similar manner to the [[T-55AM-1]]. The hull and turret feature add-on composite armour, including the conspicuous \"brow\" arrays on the turret cheeks. The gun is now equipped with a thermal sleeve and can fire improved APFSDS, HEATFS and HE shells in addition to a potent ATGM. A laser rangefinder is mounted in a large box above the gun barrel, smoke grenade launchers are added to the turret side, and a more powerful engine has been installed to compensate for the increased weight of all these new features. Though the T-62M-1's gun handling and speed are still inferior to most of its competitors, it has many tools at its disposal and can be a formidable opponent despite its old chassis and somewhat crude nature.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->\n\nThe T-62M-1 has very similar armour to the T-55AM-1, having similar composite add-on armour. The turret cheeks are protected by large curved composite blocks, sometimes historically referred to as \"Brezhnev's Eyebrows\" due to their appearance. These mean the turret can withstand many kinetic rounds, including any APFSDS that has less than 400 mm of penetration. The protection against chemical munitions is even greater, able to stop between 450-750 mm of chemical penetration depending on the angle. The brow armour's composite covers less than it might seem; the sectors closer to the gun are not backed by metal-polymer layers and only the outer steel provides extra protection. It can help to point the turret slightly away from opponents to reduce the chances of getting hit in the non-composite zones.\n\nThe hull protection is less, although still relevant. The hull composite will stop APDS and HEAT rounds from the L7 105 mm gun, but any more powerful rounds will penetrate. The hull sides are relatively well protected. 80 mm RHA will stop most autocannon rounds, and the composite skirts as well as flaps can stop HEAT rounds at an angle.\n\nFrontal weak points include the cannon breech area, as it is not covered by the add-on composite. Additionally the lower front plate is not protected by composite. These areas are easy to penetrate. The hull sides also are only 20 mm near the bottom, which is a weakness that can be exploited by autocannons. That said, there is essentially nothing important in those areas. The rear armour is not worth mentioning, as it will not stop anything larger than a heavy machine gun.\n\nSide flaps similar to those used on the [[T-64A (1971)]] can be equipped on the T-62M-1 with an unlockable modification. They add 30 kg of mass to the tank, which is a negligible penalty, and help to block HEATFS projectiles and ATGMs from side-aspect shots. Each flap will fall off after being hit, so do not count on being able to body-block an entire barrage of chemical rounds.\n\nThe T-62M-1 also has wet ammunition storage bins. 16 rounds are placed within the fuel tank located beside the driver, acting as a spaced armour, protecting the ammunition from HEAT. Successive HEAT shots might still detonate the ammunition. Note that APFSDS can detonate the rounds with ease, so avoid being shot in the hull if possible.\n\n'''Armour type:'''\n\n* Rolled homogeneous armour (hull)\n* Cast homogeneous armour (turret, cupola)\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Considering the tank's long reload time, the HE shell is a situational choice.\n* The 9M117 gun-launched ATGM has 600 mm of penetration and is mouse-guided. It is the most versatile of the chemical projectiles since it can be used against helicopters, can cause overpressure on lightly-armoured and open-topped vehicles, and has the highest penetration. Taking a few into battle is a good idea.\n* The 3BM21 APFSDS far exceeds any of the APFSDS rounds available to the original T-62.\n* The 3BM28 APFSDS significantly improves on the angled penetrative performance of 3BM21, at the expense of lower flat penetration.\n\nAPFSDS rounds should be the primary ammo choice for the {{PAGENAME}}, but its selection of three types of chemical rounds should not be overlooked either.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"100%\"\n! colspan=\"8\" | Penetration statistics\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" data-sort-type=\"text\" | Ammunition\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Type of<br>warhead\n! colspan=\"6\" | Penetration @ 0° Angle of Attack (mm)\n|-\n! 10 m !! 100 m !! 500 m !! 1,000 m !! 1,500 m !! 2,000 m\n|-\n| 3BK15M || HEATFS || 500 || 500 || 500 || 500 || 500 || 500\n|-\n| 3OF27 || HE || 40 || 40 || 40 || 40 || 40 || 40\n|-\n| 9M117 || ATGM || 600 || 600 || 600 || 600 || 600 || 600\n|-\n| 3BM21 || APFSDS || 420 || 415 || 405 || 390 || 380 || 370\n|-\n| 3BM28 || APFSDS || 386 || 384 || 377 || 369 || 361 || 352\n|-\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"100%\"\n! colspan=\"10\" | Shell details\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" data-sort-type=\"text\" | Ammunition\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Type of<br>warhead\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Velocity<br>(m/s)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Projectile<br>Mass (kg)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Fuse delay<br>(m)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Fuse sensitivity<br>(mm)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Explosive Mass<br>(TNT equivalent) (g)\n! colspan=\"3\" | Ricochet\n|-\n! 0% !! 50% !! 100%\n|-\n| 3BK15M || HEATFS || 1,060 || 12.2 || 0.05 || 0.1 || 2,280 || 65° || 72° || 77°\n|-\n| 3OF27 || HE || 800 || 17.82 || 0 || 0.1 || 4,820 || 79° || 80° || 81°\n|-\n| 3BM21 || APFSDS || 1,600 || 4.55 || N/A || N/A || N/A || 76° || 77° || 80°\n|-\n| 3BM28 || APFSDS || 1,600 || 4.88 || N/A || N/A || N/A || 78° || 80° || 81°\n|-\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"100%\"\n! colspan=\"11\" | Shell details\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" data-sort-type=\"text\" | Ammunition\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Type of<br>warhead\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Velocity<br>(m/s)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Range<br>(m)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Projectile<br>Mass (kg)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Fuse delay<br>(m)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Fuse sensitivity<br>(mm)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Explosive Mass<br>(TNT equivalent) (g)\n! colspan=\"3\" | Ricochet\n|-\n! 0% !! 50% !! 100%\n|-\n| 9M117 || ATGM || 370 || 5,000 || 18.8 || 0.05 || 0.1 || 4,620 || 80° || 82° || 90°\n|-\n|}\n\n==== [[Ammo racks]] ====\n[[File:Ammoracks_{{PAGENAME}}.png|right|thumb|x250px|[[Ammo racks]] of the {{PAGENAME}}]]\n<!-- '''Last updated: 2.13.0.180''' -->\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\nThe T-62M-1 should be played like other high tier Soviet MBTs, though with an higher emphasis on range and cover. Hide your hull and use your almost impenetrable turret armour to deflect hostile fire. If possible, try to use cover to conceal your cannon breech, as a well-placed APFSDS can disable your cannon and, depending on which side of tank you were hit from, kill your gunner or loader. A turret penetration may result in a knock out by a single shot if it hits your ammo. Do not allow yourself to fall into close-range combat areas if at all possible.\n\nThose who have fought and/or used the T-55AM-1 will find the same tactics and assumptions work against the T-62M-1, as well. It performs similarly, mostly just having upgraded the strengths the T-55AM-1 is known for; the turret armour is even better, and the power of the variety of rounds these tanks are known for has been increased, thanks to the increased calibre of the cannon (from 100 mm on the T-55AM-1 to 115 mm on the T-62M-1). This allows the T-62M-1 to have ways of dealing with vehicles all the way up to 9.7.\n\nThanks to the incredible turret armour, and highly effective and varied ammunition choices, the T-62M-1 is highly suited for a long-range sniping and support role. Players of tanks such as the Chieftain will have an idea of the playstyle. Use your fast and powerful APFSDS rounds to quickly disable targets travelling quickly at ranges out to several kilometres, use your potent HEATFS to dispatch targets at closer ranges, or fire the breech-loaded ATGM for highly accurate shots against exposed targets, both ground and air (especially against helicopters).\n\nTry to avoid close-range engagements at all costs. The T-62M-1 suffers in almost all regards compared to other tanks at closer ranges. Compared to other common tanks, such as the [[XM-1 (GM)]], the T-62M-1 has a far longer reload, worse acceleration and top speed, a larger and slower turning circle, and a poorer turret traverse speed. If you get caught out, try to take quick shots to disable the mobility of enemy tanks if you cannot out-right kill them, and make your goal of upmost importance to leave the area immediately. Use your smoke launchers to hide your retreat, and cover your upper frontal plate at all costs; a penetration on the left side of your front plate will spell instant death.\n\nBeware of fast MBTs like the [[Leopard A1A1]], as their mobility allows them to easily flank you and get a shot into your weaker side armour. The T-62M-1 is currently unlikely to face many tanks capable of penetrating its turret composite armour. The majority of deaths will likely result from being shot through weak spots or from flanking, so avoiding these should be your primary concern.\n\nYour tank also has a large amount of weak spots from even the slightest angle above you, so make sure you take enemy helicopters seriously and deal with them as fast as possible. Your gun elevation isn't the greatest, so make sure you use terrain to help lift your gun as well as present thicker armour profiles.\n\n===Fighting the T-62M-1===\nThe T-62M-1's core strengths lie in the frontal armour and versatile ammunition choices. Do not attempt to out-snipe a T-62M-1 in anything short of a hull-down British MBT. Instead, abuse the T-62M-1's inferior mobility to out-flank it and quickly disable the gun. At closer ranges with higher penetration shells (260+ mm penetration, chemical or kinetic), shooting the cannon breech can also serve to turn the T-62M-1 into an easy kill.\n\nIf you're engaging a wary T-62M-1 at closer ranges, try to bait out a shot or wait until he fires. The T-62M-1, depending on crew skills, has a reload of up to 12 seconds, giving a smart opponent plenty of time to take out a T-62M-1 after he fires. Using smoke to hide a quick change in your position can also work well, as both the T-62M-1 itself and its turret turn slowly compared to vehicles it will face, giving you time to drive around it in the confusion. You can also fire at the lower glacis to knock out the driver and gunner.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness.

However, the country also had a rather large fleet of \"old-school\" models that were no longer a match for the newest tanks but still possessed some modernization potential. So, in 1981 the government approved a project on the complex modernization of the [[T-62]]s. The aim of the project was to upgrade the defenses and augment the tanks' firepower. Following several radical design changes, the tank's combat effectiveness – despite the resurfaced issues and substantial age of the model – was significantly increased, putting the modified T-62M-1 on the same level as the third-generation tanks.\n\n''- From [[wt:en/news/5538-development-t-62m-1-the-fight-continues-en|Devblog]]''\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=ussr_t_62m1 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|LufGqZTfvoI|'''MBTs with Best Armor''' discusses the {{PAGENAME}} at 00:41 - ''War Thunder Official Channel''|UoJmO-g3UWE|'''T-62M-1 - The Russian Black Sheep''' - ''JustinPlaysYT''|7oYbFh9QxZo|'''{{PAGENAME}} Tank Review''' - ''NUSensei''|goszFx1uQCw|'''The Shooting Range #103''' - ''Metal Beasts'' section at 04:18 discusses the T-62M-1.|cnH3SbDA1RY|'''T-62M-1 - High Tier Feelings - First Impressions''' - ''Napalmratte''}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n;Other vehicles of similar configuration and role\n\n* [[T-54/55 (Family)]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wt:en/news/5538-development-t-62m-1-the-fight-continues-en|[Devblog] T-62M-1: the fight continues!]]\n* [[wikipedia:T-62|[Wikipedia] T-62]]\n* [https://weaponsystems.net/system/634-T-62M <nowiki>[Weapon Systems]</nowiki> T-62M]\n\n{{USSR medium tanks}}\n[[Category:ATGM vehicles]]"}}
