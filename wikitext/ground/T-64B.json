In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Soviet medium tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.77 \"Advancing Storm\"]]. In [[Update 1.79 \"Project X\"]], the vehicle gained the modification to equip \"Kontakt-1\" ERA blocks, transforming the variant into a '''T-64BV'''.\n\nThe T-64B is a fearsome opponent on the battlefield that improves on the infamy of its older brother, the T-64A. Its triple-layer composite armour is capable of shrugging off hits from most of the other top rank cannons, however its lacklustre engine power can prove a little underwhelming in the face of the turbine engines and hugely powerful turbo diesels the vehicles it competes against sport. The 125mm 2A46M-1 \"Sprut\" cannon comes with ammunition perfectly capable of perforating almost all forms of armour on the battlefield, regardless of operating range. The low profile of the T-64B allows it to avoid detection and utilize forms of cover that other tanks cannot hide behind. The T-64B can be differentiated from the T-64A by the lack of the side extrusion panels, however is visually extremely similar to the T-80B and it's often hard to differentiate, especially when the armour package is applied. The T-64B gains a pintle-mounted machine gun which can prove useful as a deterrent against CAS and some light vehicles.\n\nWith the \"Kontakt-1\" ERA upgrade, the tank's appearance drastically changes. The ERA is fitted in a \"pike\" or triangular prism shape. The hull is also different as its covered with ERA and the distinctive triangle at the front is gone. There is also an extra armour plate on the lower plate.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection.

While the armour of the T-64B was good for its time, many later vehicles can fairly reliably penetrate the UFP, even through the composite armour. The gun performs well, with a good variety of ammunition, an autoloader for reliable reload times (even when a crew member is knocked, or putting out fires) and extremely high round velocity for long-range ease of use.\n\nThe T-64B can be used as a brawling tank but positioning is key - wherever possible, the LFP should not be exposed, and due to the abysmally low reverse speed, there's usually no escape from a sticky situation. Play carefully in close quarters environments, letting targets move into your gunsights rather than vice versa.\n\nKeep in mind that the vehicle is relatively slow, so you'll often be one of the last into battle. This gives you an opportunity to exploit known intel - where your teammates have been shot/destroyed from, primarily - which can be used to position, ready for pushing enemy tanks.\n\n'''T-64BV'''\n\nOne of the later upgrades available to the T-64B is the \"additional protection\" upgrade, which covers the frontal hull and turret with \"Kontakt-1\" ERA. This adds a huge amount of protection to the vehicle specifically against chemical rounds. While it's uncommon to see top rank MBTs use HEAT rounds, it can prove useful when facing IFVs/ATGM carriers, or in many cases, helicopters with ATGMs. The weight increase is often well worth the benefits of the BV upgrade.\n\n'''Top-rank Adversaries'''\n\n* [[M1 Abrams (Family)|M1/IPM1/M1A1 Abrams]]: The Abrams series of vehicles are significantly faster than the T-64B, and will almost always get into position before you're able to. The best way to combat them is to catch them while they're pushing. Be careful with shot placement, however, because of the nature of the Abrams vehicles it's often very hard to guarantee a single-shot vehicle knockout - if necessary, disable the vehicle's gunner/weapon first. When you have a clear shot on the back of an Abrams' turret, try to place it through the ammunition and the blast door: this often results in ammo detonation and the vehicle's destruction.\n\n* [[Leopard 2K]]: The Leopard 2K has negligible armour and can often be destroyed with a well placed shot almost anywhere - beware the highly angled surfaces, however, which will bounce shots you may not expect it to. Watch out for the Leopard's mobility, though - it can flank quickly and the L/44 120mm can be deadly.\n\n* [[Leopard 2A4]]/[[Leopard 2A5|2A5]]: The Leopard 2A4/2A5 are similar vehicles to face, although the 2A5 can prove significantly harder to kill. Both vehicles are reasonably mobile, especially compared to the T-64. The best option for both vehicles is to try to get a side shot - but if this isn't possible, try for a round through the lower plate. Where this isn't possible, try destroy the gun directly or place a shot through the turret ring - but avoid the turret cheeks on these vehicles, as they're near impenetrable.\n\n* [[Challenger Mk.2]]/[[Challenger Mk.3|Mk.3]]/[[Challenger 2|2]]: These vehicles can be extremely hard to destroy when they're in a hull-down position - their turret cheeks are extremely well protected and the mantlet is small and hard to place a round through. If you're forced to engage one at long range, it's best to try your best to land a shot in the mantlet or the lower half of the turret cheeks, which are slightly weaker. When a Challenger is exposed, however, simply place a shell through the massive LFP and reap the rewards.\n\n* [[Leclerc]]: The easiest way to disable it is through the huge gun mantlet, and from there putting shots into the LFP/turret ring/mantlet as necessary.\n\n* [[Ariete]]/[[Ariete PSO|PSO]]: The Ariete is reasonably easy to destroy - it has a reasonably vulnerable hull, although the turret can be slightly harder to deal with. Still avoid being a target, because due to the compact nature of the T-64 and spread out ammunition, if an Ariete penetrates you, there's a pretty good chance you're a goner.\n\n'''How to fight the T-64B'''\n\nDisable its gun: the gun mantlet is very weak against top tier shells so it will be destroyed. Even if a shell can penetrate the composite armour, make sure the T-64B can not hit you back as it will penetrate most vehicles it can face. The driver port does not contain composite armour. Rounds with 200 mm of penetration can penetrate effectively, almost guaranteeing a kill. However at long ranges this is a very small target so try and hit the T-64B's gun. The lower plate is a very big weak spot as there is no composite armour there. Any top tier shell will penetrate at close to medium range. However at long ranges the lower plate is a very small target so try and disable the T-64B's gun. Vehicles such as the Type-90 or Ariete C1 are capable of punching straight through the hull composite armour.\n\nFighting the T-64BV (T-64B with \"Kontakt-1\" ERA) is a different situation. With the ERA, protection against chemical is 850 mm and above meaning it can stop the HOT missile and DM12 HEAT-FS. If you have an autocannon fire at the ERA to destroy it. Once it is gone you the value will drop to 500 mm against chemical rounds. In some cases, a if a projectile with lots of explosive hits the breech or the ERA on turret, some shrapnel will deflect downwards into the ammunition, destroying the tank even though the projectile was stopped. However, the provides minimal protection against kinetic rounds.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as \"bad\", \"good\" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as \"inadequate\" and \"effective\".'' -->\n\n'''Pros:'''\n\n* Stock-friendly grind, with decent stock HEAT shell and potent HE shell\n* Upgraded hull armour allows it to shrug off hits from many top-rank cannons\n* Lower profile compared to other MBTs, allows the user to utilize cover and tactics that other players cannot use\n* Ability to mount the Kontakt-1 Explosive Reactive Armour package which enhances first-hit protection against chemical munitions\n* Very strong turret armour combined with a bad but usable -6° gun depression can allow it to hull down relatively well in some instances\n* Upgraded 125 mm cannon inherited from the previous model\n* The high muzzle velocity on the T-64B's APFSDS rounds make it an excellent sniper\n* More diverse ammunition choices gives it a great deal of flexibility and allows it to engage at any distance and adapt to different situations and playstyle\n* 9M112 \"Kobra\" ATGM capable of penetrating 650 mm of armour\n* Replaces the \"oil barrel\" smoke grenades with two sets of four-barrelled smoke grenade launchers\n* Good optics allow for more accurate shots at long range\n\n'''Cons:'''\n\n* Horrible reverse speed\n* Bad gun depression compared to its adversaries\n* Gun elevation/depression speed is very slow compared to other MBTs (2.4 degrees per second)\n* HEAT-FS shell requires skill against its contemporaries' armour, simply pointing and firing it will not guarantee a penetration\n* High risk of ammunition detonation thanks to the vertical nature of the autoloader\n* The hull armour is not good enough to reliably stop APFSDS shells from the most higher-tier tanks.\n* Angling the tank causes the weak side armour to be exposed and let APFSDS to tear through the ammo carousel\n\n== History ==\n<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction.

The T-64B model was now fitted with a better laser range finder along with improved fire control systems. In addition, it had the 2A46M-1 cannon (aka the D-81TM gun) with a 2E26M stabilizer, 6ETs40 autoloader, 1A33 FCS (fire control system) comprising a ballistic calculator, and a sight with laser telemetry and cross-wind sensor. The ATGMs were eight 9M112 \"Kobra\" (radio-guided, NATO \"AT-8 Songster\"). The turret armour had a new design consisting of ceramic balls designed to absorb or reduce chemical munitions. However the T-64B still had the unreliable and complicated 5TDF engine. Designers added a more powerful engine which led to the T-72B and T-80 series.\n\n===Combat usage===\nAlthough there is no hard evidence, some sources saw the T-64B saw action in Afghanistan in the 1980s. This could have been for testing but there are no official records. Russia had 4,000 T-64Bs, but 2,000 were put out of service in 2000 and used for scrap. The T-64B and BV-1 model is currently used by The Democratic Republic of Congo. 50 were purchased from Ukraine in 2014. The T-64B saw heavy action in the 2014 Ukraine Civil War and Invasion of Crimea. 17 T-64B were confirmed destroyed, including the \"Bulat\" model. Ukraine is now upgrading there there fleet of T-64B to a more modernized version called the T-64BM \"Bulat\"\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=ussr_t_64_b_1984 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Images\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:T-64B Snow.JPG|250px|thumb|none|The T-64B in War Thunder with Winter Camouflage\n</gallery>\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|P6SfZC-n-U4|'''T-64B vs M1 Abrams''' - ''War Thunder Official Channel''|9VBAWLdfLcw|'''The Shooting Range #90''' - ''Metal Beasts'' section at 00:26 discusses the T-64B.}}\n\n== See also ==\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wt:en/news/5351-development-t-64b-when-good-is-not-good-enough-en|[Devblog] T-64B: When Good Is Not Good Enough]]\n* [[wt:en/news/5503-development-t-64bv-defence-reaction-en|[Devblog] T-64BV: Defence Reaction]]\n\n{{TankManufacturer Morozov}}\n{{USSR medium tanks}}\n\n[[Category:ATGM vehicles]]"}}
