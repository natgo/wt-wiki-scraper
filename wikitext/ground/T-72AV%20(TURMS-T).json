For the purpose of clarity, rack 2 is considered empty even if that charge is still present.\n* Rack 4 (autoloader carrousel) is a first stage ammo rack containing 22 projectiles and 22 propellant charges.\n** This rack gets filled first when loading up the tank and is also emptied first.\n** As the {{PAGENAME}} is equipped with an autoloader, manual reloading of the gun is not possible.\n** Once the autoloader magazine has been depleted, you can't shoot until the loader has restocked the autoloader with at least one shell. The restocking time is longer than the normal reload time of the gun. Take this into account when playing.\n** Simply not firing when the gun is loaded will move ammo from racks 1 to 3 into rack 4. Firing will interrupt the restocking of the ready rack.\n\n=== Machine guns ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Weapon|2}}\n{{Specs-Tank-Weapon|3}}\n<!-- ''Offensive and anti-aircraft machine guns not only allow you to fight some aircraft but also are effective against lightly armoured vehicles.

The TURMS fire control system, developed by the Italian company Officine Galileo, was previously used on C1 Ariete tanks. In the early 2000's, this fire control system was adopted for the T-72.\n\nThe system significantly improves the tank's vision capabilities, thanks to the commander's panoramic sight. It also features a high-quality thermal imaging gunner's sight, which allows the tank to effectively perform combat missions at night and in poor visibility conditions. By 2006, 122 TURMS kits were produced for the Syrian army.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=ussr_t_72av_turms Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Images\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:T-72AV TURMS WTWallpaper 001.jpg\nFile:T-72AV TURMS WTWallpaper 002.jpg\nFile:T-72AV TURMS WTWallpaper 003.jpg\nFile:T-72AV TURMS WTWallpaper 004.jpg\nFile:T-72AV TURMS WTWallpaper 005.jpg\nT-72AV (TURMS-T) wide angle.jpg|T-72AV (TURMS-T) in Late Green Camouflage obtainable in-game\n</gallery>\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|kVerE5W_kao|Premium Vehicles: T-72AV (TURMS-T) - War Thunder Wiki|pAXRsI9QB5A|'''Soviet Star: T-72AV TURMS Review''' - ''Sako Sniper''|X-tzo6wzwOw|'''The Syrian Beast - T-72A TURMS-T''' - ''JustinPlaysYT''}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n;Other Rank VI vehicles equipped with ERA protection\n\n* [[M60A3 TTS]]\n* [[T-69 II G]]\n* [[CM11]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wt:en/news/6910-development-t-72av-turms-t-syrian-guard-en|[Devblog] T-72AV (TURMS-T): Syrian Guard]]\n\n{{TankManufacturer Uralvagonzavod}}\n{{USSR medium tanks}}\n{{USSR premium ground vehicles}}"}}
