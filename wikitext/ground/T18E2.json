In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a gift rank {{Specs|rank}} American light tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.77 \"Advancing Storm\"]] in the 2018 \"Chronicles of World War II\" that took place between the 14th of April till the 10th of May of the same year. It was obtainable by earning 6 \"Chronicle awards\" in ground vehicles.\n\nThe T18E2 is an American heavy armoured car built on an 8 x 8 suspension and features a [[M1 (57 mm)|57 mm M1]] cannon.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->\nThe T18E2 is a heavy armoured car that favours protection over the high mobility common to the class.  The T18E2's hull is solidly protected from heavy machine guns and artillery shrapnel, but most opponents at this battle rating can penetrate it without trouble.  Despite sufficient armour to protect the crew, the transmission located under the floor armour is very susceptible to damage from artillery.\n\nThe vehicle carries a full complement of 5 crew members. A driver and MG gunner sit together in the forward driving compartment, while the Gunner, Loader, and Commander sit in close proximity in the rather small turret in the fighting compartment. Altogether, a well placed APHE round can be enough to knock out all of the crew members in the vehicle but may survive multiple solid shots of AP or APCR rounds, especially from the side. However, the crew is positioned deceptively high off the ground above an armoured floor, and so shots to the very lower glacis frequently only damage the transmission.\n\n'''Armour type''':\n\n* Cast Homogeneous armour (turret, hull front and sides)\n* Rolled Homogeneous armour (hull rear and hull roof)\n* Structural Steel (fender, various boxes along the hull, and vents on engine compartment)\n* Wheels\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->\n\n{{tankMobility|abMinHp=387|rbMinHp=221}}\n\nIn RB/SB mode, the {{PAGENAME}} is a very sluggish vehicle, especially compared to other armoured cars. Despite its listed top speed of 80 km/h (50 mph), most drivers will only see up to 65 km/h (40 mph) on paved roads and 39 km/h (24 mph) cross country depending on terrain. Even so, with its low power to weight ratio of 10.41 hp/ton (in comparison to 14.44 hp/ton of the M3 Lee), it takes driving relatively straight for a long while for it to reach these speeds. Best stick to paved roads when you can if you need to be somewhere quick and avoid muddy terrain altogether like that found at White Rock Fortress, where mud can drag your speed down to as low as 8 km/h (5 mph), leaving you vulnerable if trying to cross potential fire zones quickly.\n\nThe {{PAGENAME}} also possesses a very high top reverse speed of -36 km/h (-20 mph), though again because of its low acceleration, will take some time to possibly reach this. However, in comparison to other tanks, the reverse acceleration and eventual speed is still acceptable for quick retreats. This can even mitigate the disadvantage that the vehicle requires a large turn radius to turn around.\n\n=== Modifications and economy ===\n{{Specs-Economy}}\n\n== Armaments ==\n{{Specs-Tank-Armaments}}\n=== Main armament ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Weapon|1}}\n<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun.

Ford built the T17 Deerhound and T17E1 Staghound for the medium requirement. Development for the heavy armoured car was headed by the Yellow Coach Company.\n\nThe prototype for the heavy armoured car was displayed in 1942, and the design became the T18. It was being designed for the British Army, who wanted them for the war in North Africa, where the mobility of armoured cars would be beneficial at the time.\n\n'''Design'''\n\nThe T18 used an 8x8 wheeled chassis with four total axles, the front two paired together and the rear two paired together. The vehicle had a length of 20.4 feet, a width of 10 feet, and a height of 8.5 feet. It weighed around 30 tons, and was operated by a crew of five, with the driver and co-driver/machine gunner in the hull front and the commander, gunner, and loader in the turret.\n\nThe three-man turret was located on the center of the hull. The main armament consisted of a 37 mm M6 anti-tank gun. A coaxial 7.62 mm M1919A4 was mounted in the turret, and a second M1919 machine gun was ball-mounted in the hull front for use by the co-driver/machine gunner.\n\nArmour protection of the T18 was from 9.5 mm to 50.8 mm.\n\nThe T18 was powered by two GMC 6-cylinder engines, each producing 125 horsepower, for a total of 250 horsepower. The T18 could reach speeds of 50 miles per hour and had a range of 250 miles.\n\n=== T18E2 Boarhound ===\n'''Development'''\n\nBefore the T18 had been delivered to the British Army, it was seen in the North African theatre that the 37 mm had become insufficient against the latest German panzers. As such, it was decided to replace the 37 mm M6 gun with a 57 mm M1 anti-tank gun (a license-produced version of the QF 6-pounder). Sixty 57 mm projectiles were carried, and 2,500 rounds of machine gun ammunition were carried as well. The vehicle with the 57 mm gun was designated as the '''T18E2'''.\n\n'''Production and Service'''\n\nThe T18E2 was designated by the British Army as the Boarhound, and 2,500 Boarhounds were planned to be acquired. By the time deliveries began, the war in North Africa was coming to a close, and the Boarhound also had poor off-road mobility. These factors, in addition to a high unit cost, caused the British Army to cut the order short at just 30 units. Very few Boarhounds saw combat, and none saw heavy combat. They were mostly used for convoy escort, base defence, or reconnaissance.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicleCountry=usa&vehicleType=tank&vehicleClass=light_tank&vehicle=us_t18_e2 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|RGeu2yLGeTU|'''Best armoured cars''' discusses the {{PAGENAME}} at 2:55 - ''War Thunder Official Channel''|PosWOnOGkSo|'''Best experimental vehicles''' discusses the {{PAGENAME}} at 5:08 - ''War Thunder Official Channel''|YZtAEsSpwNM|'''The Shooting Range #96''' - ''Metal Beasts'' section at 04:52 discusses the {{PAGENAME}}.}}\n\n== See also ==\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.''\n\n{{TankManufacturer Ordnance Department}}\n{{USA light tanks}}\n{{USA premium ground vehicles}}\n[[Category:Wheeled ground vehicles]]"}}
