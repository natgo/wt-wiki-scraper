It was introduced in [[Update 1.57 \"Battle March\"]]. The tank takes the basis of a normal [[M26|M26 Pershing]], then increases its armour with welded-on metal slabs and up-guns it with a [[T15E1 (90 mm)|T15E1 cannon]], which is nearly identical to the one in the [[T32]]. This gives the tank a much appreciated armour protection and firepower for the battle rating and is comparable with the premium [[M26E1]].\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection.

The gun's greatest weakness is its reload time, allowing more than sufficient time for the enemy to move out of their cover, aim, and take a shot. Therefore, staying in cover between shots and near friendlies might be preferable. A mix of T41 APCBC and T44 APCR shells is recommended as a typical load-out.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"100%\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" | [[T15E1 (90 mm)|90 mm T15E1]] || colspan=\"5\" | Turret rotation speed (°/s) || colspan=\"4\" | Reloading rate (seconds)\n|-\n!

For Arcade Battles, 15 shells is typically sufficient, majority APCBC with roughly 3-5 APCR shells dedicated to enemies with better armour. The APCBC shell is a good default for a majority of targets, it typically should be loaded when venturing towards the unknown.\n\n* T43 shot - {{Annotation|APBC|Armour-Piercing Ballistic Capped}} - Acceptable performance against majority of targets\n* T42 shell - {{Annotation|HE|High-Explosive fragmentation shell}} - Usable nearly exclusively against soft targets.

Its frontal protection is not that reliable, especially against long 88 mm guns, at the same time its very unconventional, giving a large number of smaller weak spots. Therefore, it's recommended to stay on the move, or even rotating turret left and right to increase chances of deflecting the shot. Unlike with [[T34]] simply staying hull-down is not viable due to weak spots at top of the turret and bottom turret cheeks - it's best to hide an entire body between shots, letting allies lure the attention of the enemy team.\n\nIt's also one of the weakest tanks when played solo, owning it to low mobility, very weak side armour and a very long reload time. With 76 mm it can be penetrated by every tank it encounters and a number of anti-aircraft guns. Therefore an additional situational awareness is required to always have allies in proximity, in fact: if need be, tactical retreats might be worth a risk, as if left alone a single hit without mobility kill on a hostile unit can mean a near-certain death.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness.

It has high accuracy, velocity, penetration, and damage potential.\n* The T44 APCR shell can penetrate up to 336 mm, rivalling or even beating some rank VI APFSDS ammunition.\n* Despite all the added armour and new 90 mm gun, the tank still gets an impressive 10 degrees of gun depression.\n* The turret armour coupled with the gun depression give this tank great potential when it comes to shooting over hills and prolonged hull down fighting.\n* Has a roof mounted .50 cal machine gun.\n\n'''Cons:'''\n\n* Despite all the add-on armour, the lower plate is still susceptible to being penetrated by contemporary guns.\n* The hull machine gun port is small, but still a weak spot that is easily penetrated.\n* The spaced armour doesn't really help against HEAT, APDS, or Soviet 122 mm AP shells.\n* All the added armour coupled with the weak engine give this tank terrible acceleration and hill climbing capabilities.\n* The vertical aiming drive can be damaged by simply shooting the two springs on the turret roof with mere machine guns.\n* The turret spaced armour doesn't cover the  weakly armoured corners of the lower turret. Can be easily penetrated by contemporary guns.\n* The 90 mm shells are massive and take up a huge amount of the crew compartment. Any shell that penetrates the hull or left side of the turret housing the 10-round first stage ammo rack will likely destroy the vehicle.\n* Even with an ace crew, the gun will take 12.5 seconds to reload. Trading shots with a Tiger II is not a good idea.\n* While the 90 mm is a good gun, it's frankly inferior to the Tiger II's 88 mm in virtually every metric other than explosive filler mass.\n\n== History ==\n<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction.

The gun was similar in performance to the German's [[Tiger E|Tiger Is]] [[KwK 36 (88 mm)|8.8 cm KwK 36]] cannon, but Army Ordnance wanted something to match the more powerful [[KwK 43 (88 mm)|8.8 cm KwK 43]] cannon on the [[Tiger II (H)|Tiger II]]. The development to match this cannon made the [[T15E1 (90 mm)|T15 90 mm gun]]; the gun was 73 calibers long, compared to the 90 mm Gun M3's 53 calibers length. The first produced guns were called the T15E1 and had large, fixed ammunition. To test the gun's viability in the tank, the gun was mounted onto the very first production T26, T26E1 tank serial #1, registration #0103292, with the conversions being done by the Wellman Engineering Company. This upgraded tank was titled the '''T26E1-1''' by means of a painted-on designation on the turret's left side to distinguish the design, although this title was not official, and few if any sources refer to it as such. The extreme length of the T15E1 gun barrel caused the manufacturers to add a very prominent counter balance on the mantlet, which could be seen on the left side of the turret when facing it. The T26E1-1 tank was sent to Aberdeen Proving Grounds on 12 January 1945 for testing purposes.<ref name=\"PershingHunnicutt\">Hunnicutt, R.P. ''Pershing: A History of the Medium Tank T20 Series'' U.S.A.: Feist Publications, 1971</ref>\n\nIn March 1945, following the Aberdeen tests, the T26 tanks mounting the T15 gun was officially classified as the T26E4. As such, the mentioned T26E1-1 would be classified as the first of the T26E4 models, with an initial procurement plan for 1,000 more units. The first T26E4 (henceforth referred to as T26E1-1) would be the only M26 model with the T15 gun to see service in Europe. Among the troops, the T26E1-1 in Europe would be known by its eponymous name '''\"Super Pershing\"''' when compared alongside to the normal M26 Pershing.<ref name=\"PershingHunnicutt\">Hunnicutt, R.P. ''Pershing: A History of the Medium Tank T20 Series'' U.S.A.: Feist Publications, 1971</ref>\n\n===Combat usage===\nThe T26E1-1 \"Super Pershing\" was sent to Europe and arrived in 15 March 1945 and assigned to the 3rd Armored Division. In its introduction, the \"Super Pershing\" was given additional armour by the maintenance crew in hopes to keep it up to date against the heavier German tanks. The front hull had two large pieces of metal welded onto it, each 38 mm in thickness, with a space in between the metal pieces. These metal pieces were sloped more than the hull armour it was over. An additional armour piece was welded on the turret mantlet, the metal was taken from a Panther turret and was about 80 mm thick when welded onto the turret.<ref name=\"PershingHunnicutt\">Hunnicutt, R.P. ''Pershing: A History of the Medium Tank T20 Series'' U.S.A.: Feist Publications, 1971</ref> The T15E1 gun has much promise to the crew when using the tank as the gun could reliably penetrate the frontal hull of a [[Panther G|Panther]] tank, a feat not many other American tank gun could claim at the time.\n\nThe T26E1-1's performance in battle is largely written in the accounts of John P. Irwin, who was the tank gunner of the only active \"Super Pershing\" in the war. He mentions of three prominent combat actions with the T26E1-1, each one destroying the enemy with little difficulty. Records show that the T26E1-1 destroyed a total of three tanks and captured one after an extended firefight that left the opposing tank out of ammunition. Though it was hoped to have the T26E1-1 fight a Tiger II for a rather explosive comparison, the T26E1-1 never saw a Tiger II during its tour in Europe. After the war, the T26E1-1 was most likely scrapped in the post-war demobilization as the final image of the tank was it lying in a vehicle dump in Kassel, Germany.\n\n===Legacy and similar vehicles===\nThe T26E1-1 continued as an idea long after the war was over, with the next development arming the long 90 mm cannon in the T26E3 tank models, but the cannons used the new two-piece ammunition gun T15E2 rather than the one-piece one in the T15E1 when it was found that the long 50 inch rounds made loading prohibitive in the M26 turret. 25 of these tanks were built and were designated the T26E4. Another development was to convert normal M26 Pershings to mounting the T54 cannon, another development of the T15E1 which featured shorter ammunition. These tanks were redesignated the [[M26E1|M26E1]], but work was halted due to issues with the guns and a cut in project funds.<ref name=\"PershingHunnicutt\">Hunnicutt, R.P.
