Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium gift rank {{Specs|rank}} American heavy tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.85 \"Supersonic\"]] in the 2018 \"Festive Quest\" that took place between 21 December 2018 to 14 January 2019. It was obtainable via completing 10 Christmas Toys for tankers. It could also be purchased on the Gaijin market after the event was over.\n\nThe {{Specs|pseudonym}} was a World War II American tank project developed to counter new German tanks, such as Tiger I, Tiger II, and tank destroyers, such as the ''Jagdtiger'', or Soviet heavy tanks, such as IS-1 or IS-2. The T30 was designed at the same time as the T29 Heavy Tank. However, it had a 155mm gun mounted on the same hull and turret as the T29 and T34 heavy tanks.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection.

With its long reload for the 155 mm makes its gameplay a bit similar to the [[KV-2]] than tanks like [[T29]] or [[T34]]. The T30 can handle itself on its own if in a one on one encounter but will be at a disadvantage if it is facing more than one due to the long reload time. So to fully utilize that heavy gun, it might be best to be a supportive role tank for the medium tanks or the MBTs that have a faster reload but not the same destructive power as the T30's 155 mm has.\n\nThe T30 share similarities with the armour as the [[T29]] and [[T34]], having a thick heavily armoured turret has its advantages. Since its most heavily armoured part is the front turret it can be a key factor on how to make plans where to best utilize the tank, keep in mind even if having the turret only exposed it's not a 100% guaranteed safety from shells like APDS that will with ease be able to penetrate turret. But shells like HEAT-FS will mostly not do same amount of damage but can take out the gunner or in worst case scenario the gun's breech.\n\nEnemy tanks to be aware of are mostly MBTs like [[Leopard 1]], [[M60]], [[Vickers MBT]], [[T-54 (1951)]], [[STB-1]], [[OF-40]], [[Strv 101]].  But that is not the only threat there is also ATGM Vehicles and large calibre tanks that can have enough Power to disable the T30's turret when hull down and out flank the slow T30's position.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness.

Great at taking out heavily armoured tanks if the explosion occurs over the turret, or under the hull, thanks to the the overpressure damage mechanic. \n* Both of the APCBC shells have an amazing amount damage potential. Any shot that enters an enemy's crew compartment will almost certainly lead to a one-shot.\n* Because of the slow shell velocity, this is one of the few tanks in the game that's really good at hitting targets behind cover.\n* Despite the massive breech, the tank still retains 10 degrees of gun depression.\n* Has a set of optics that give magnification levels of 4.0x - 8.0x. Excellent for both close and long range target acquisition.\n* Has two .50 cal machine guns that can easily damage lightly armoured vehicles, tracks, and gun barrels.\n\n'''Cons:'''\n\n* Has one of the worst reloads in the game. Even an ace crew using the 6-rounds first stage ammo rack will take an abysmal 29.9 seconds to reload the gun.\n* Despite the great armour, the gun's terrible reload rate renders you helpless if 2 or more enemy tanks attack you at the same time. \n* Despite being armed with a 155 mm gun, even the top APCBC shell has abysmal penetration against angled armour like the Panther's front plate. \n* The top APCBC shell only has 199 mm of penetration at point blank range.\n* The advantage of having incredible optics is negated by the bad shell velocity and accuracy of the 155 mm shells. Hitting a moving target is difficult, and hitting anything past 1,000 m is basically impossible.\n* Despite the 6-man crew, the sheer size of 155 mm shells and cases means that any enemy APHE shell that enters the T30's hull or turret will likely end in an ammo explosion.\n* Has one less .50 cal machine gun than the T29 and [[T34]].\n* Due to the horrendous rate of fire, the {{PAGENAME}} is heavily reliant and friendly vehicle support. In other words, carrying games is difficult.\n\n== History ==\n<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction.

This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->\n\nIn 1944, the Army requested 4 prototypes for heavy tanks, two armed with a 105 mm gun and two armed with a 155 mm gun. The intention was to create vehicles that could face enemy heavy tanks on even terms, or even advantageous terms. The vehicles armed with the 105 mm gun were designated [[T29]], and the two armed with a 155 mm gun were designated [[T30]].\n\nThe armament of the T30, a 155 mm T7 L/40 gun, was one of the largest guns ever fitted to an armored fighting vehicle made in the United States. The gun was carried in a tall, long turret with rounded edges. The height of the turret was quite necessary, as the size of the gun and its ammunition required a standing loader. The hull of the T30 was the same as the T29. It was a lengthened version of the [[M26|T26E3 chassis]]. The armor of the T30 was quite thick, and the hull was also well angled, as one of the requirements for the design was protection from the German [[KwK43 (88 mm)|long 88 mm anti-tank gun]]. The T30 carried a crew of six men. These were the driver, commander, bow machine gunner, gunner, and two loaders. One loader moved the crane that placed the shell, and the other used the rammer that put the shell into the breech. The gun could only be loaded at certain angles. The T30 saw an upgrade, called the T30E1, which added an automatic loading system, which moved the gun to the correct position, loaded the shell, and moved the gun back to the firing position. A hatch was added to the rear of the turret to allow the ejection of shell casings after firing.\n\nWorld War 2 ended before the heavy tank designs ([[T28]], [[T29]], T30, [[T32]], [[T34]]) could enter service, and the development of these vehicles ended, but the development of these heavy tank designs provided experience that proved useful when designing the [[M103|M103 heavy tank]] during the Cold War.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicleCountry=usa&vehicleType=tank&vehicleClass=heavy_tank&vehicle=us_t30 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|Ucr-wFDeLRA|'''T30  Tank Review: Missing Punch''' - ''Napalmratte''}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n;Other tanks sharing the same design:\n* [[T29 Heavy Tank (Family)]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wt:en/news/5963-development-t30-premium-heavy-tank-en|[Devblog] T30 Premium heavy tank]]\n* [[wikipedia:T30_Heavy_Tank|[Wikipedia] T30 Heavy Tank]]\n* [https://www.militaryfactory.com/armor/detail.asp?armor_id=353 Military Factory - T30 (Heavy Tank T30)]\n\n{{USA heavy tanks}}\n{{USA premium ground vehicles}}\n{{Winter Event}}"}}
