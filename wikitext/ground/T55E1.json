In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium gift rank {{Specs|rank}} American tank destroyer {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced during [[Update \"Hot Tracks\"]] as a reward for [[Battle Pass: Season II, \"Steel Centurion\"]].\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->\nThe armour on the T55 is next to none, even a random burst from a machine gun can easily kill you or critically wound your crew. However, as this vehicle cannot be hull broken and APHE shells tend not to detonate inside your tank, your most dangerous enemies are vehicles equipped with heavy machine guns or autocannons. The ammo rack is your biggest weak spot, however if you only load 10 or 12 shells, your side racks are empty and your centre rack is mostly empty. Any plane is a danger and you should seek cover and hide from them.\n\n'''Armour type:'''\n\n* Structural Steel (hull, gun breech)\n* Tires (wheel)\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Armour !!

It drives more like a car than it does a tank and has a hard time to flip. Your wheels can also allow you to climb to vantage points before anyone else.\n\n{{tankMobility|abMinHp=420|rbMinHp=262}}\n\n=== Modifications and economy ===\n{{Specs-Economy}}\n\n== Armaments ==\n{{Specs-Tank-Armaments}}\n=== Main armament ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Weapon|1}}\n<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun.

Give advice on how to use them and how to fill the ammunition storage.'' -->\n{{main|M7 (76 mm)}}\nThe {{PAGENAME}} uses the [[M7 (76 mm)|76 mm M7]] as its main and only armament. The [[M7 (76 mm)|76 mm M7]] cannon is a high velocity anti tank gun, and can punch through the armour of most tanks all the way up to 6.7. The M62 APCBC shell has enough explosive filler to take down most tanks in one well aimed shot. Such canon may be familiar to players as it is the same armament present on the [[M10 GMC]] as well as the [[M6A1]] as well as being similar to the later Shermans' 76 mm canon. The vehicle however posses a noticeable better reload than all the aforementioned vehicles due to having 2 loaders. That said, unlike the previous vehicles, the {{PAGENAME}} not only lacks a turret but also posses a very limited horizontal guidance.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"100%\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" | [[M7 (76 mm)|76 mm M7]] || colspan=\"5\" | Turret rotation speed (°/s) || colspan=\"4\" | Reloading rate (seconds)\n|-\n!

It is the highest penetrating shell available as well as having explosive filler. As such, it is recommended to use the shell for most opponents, specially armoured ones, but also for flanking as the explosive fillers can prove deadly when used against enemies side armour. As such, it is recommended to bring a considerable amount of APCBC shells.\n*'''M42A1 shell''' - The M42A1 is the HE shell the {{PAGENAME}} has access to. While such shell can be overlooked on similarly armed vehicles, the lack of a machine gun on the {{PAGENAME}} can lead to difficulties dealing with targets with exposed crew such as a number of SPAAs. As such, it is recommended to bring a low amount of HE shells in order to counter the aforementioned threat.\n*'''M79 shot''' - The M79 is an AP round that, while it lacks the penetration of the M62 or the damage of the M42A1, still has some uses in the {{PAGENAME}}. As previously mentioned, the lack of machine guns in the vehicle can lead to issues against unarmoured targets. Furthermore, due to the HE having lower penetration than the M62's fuse sensitivity, some opponents may be harder to hit with the previously mentioned shells. In such scenarios it is recommended to use the M79, being able to damage lightly armoured opponents. Due to the AP nature of the shell, as well as the lack of HE filler, it is also recommended to shoot at the front or rear of the opponent's vehicle to ensure the maximum amount of damage. As such, like the M42A1, it is recommended to bring a low amount of AP shells.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"100%\"\n! colspan=\"8\" | Penetration statistics\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" data-sort-type=\"text\" | Ammunition\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Type of<br>warhead\n! colspan=\"6\" | Penetration @ 0° Angle of Attack (mm)\n|-\n! 10 m !! 100 m !! 500 m !! 1,000 m !! 1,500 m !! 2,000 m\n|-\n| M62 shell || APCBC || 149 || 146 || 133 || 119 || 106 || 95\n|-\n| M42A1 shell || HE || 7 || 7 || 7 || 7 || 7 || 7\n|-\n| M79 shot || AP || 134 || 132 || 121 || 109 || 99 || 89\n|-\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"100%\"\n! colspan=\"10\" | Shell details\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" data-sort-type=\"text\" | Ammunition\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Type of<br>warhead\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Velocity<br>(m/s)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Projectile<br>Mass (kg)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Fuse delay<br>(m)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Fuse sensitivity<br>(mm)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Explosive Mass<br>(TNT equivalent) (g)\n! colspan=\"3\" | Ricochet\n|-\n! 0% !! 50% !! 100%\n|-\n| M62 shell || APCBC || 792 || 7 || 1.2 || 14 || 63.7 || 48° || 63° || 71°\n|-\n| M42A1 shell || HE || 800 || 5.84 || 0 || 0.1 || 390 || 79° || 80° || 81°\n|-\n| M79 shot || AP || 792 || 6.8 || N/A || N/A || N/A || 47° || 60° || 65°\n|-\n|}\n\n==== [[Ammo racks]] ====\n[[File:Ammoracks_{{PAGENAME}}.png|right|thumb|x250px|[[Ammo racks]] of the {{PAGENAME}}]]\n<!-- '''Last updated: 2.3.0.117''' -->\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!

Your speed outclasses other vehicles and you can use it to get to a flanking position or a sniping point before anyone else. Then use your gun's excellent angles to aim at a place where you can see the enemy's side. As mentioned above, try to avoid MG fire and if you can. It is not recommended to shoot on the move as you will tend to miss your shots.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness.

The vehicle used a chain drive, and the wheels were set up in two 4x4 bogies, each with it's own engine. The desert vehicle was used as the basis of a wheeled tank destroyer after they received a contract from the US Army in August 1942. One prototype was built by the Allied Machinery Manufacturing Company and was called the T55 GMC (GMC standing for Gun Motor Carriage). The T55 had the front engine moved to the rear of the hull in order to fit the main armament, a 3 inch or 76.2 mm M7 gun, at the front of the hull. After initial testing of the T55 GMC in December 1942, the Cook Brothers were requested by the Army to design an improved version.\n[[File:T55E1 (2).jpg|thumb|T55E1 GMC]]\nThe redesigned version of the T55 GMC was named the T55E1 GMC and it was basically a simplified version of the T55; both the T55 and T55E1 gained the unofficial nickname of \"Cook Interceptor\", signifying their designers. The largest visual difference was a much lower profile. The T55E1 GMC retained the 76.2 mm M7 gun from the T55 GMC, which was mounted in the front of the hull; it was casemate mounted rather than turret mounted. The T55E1 was lighter than the T55 it was based on, and as such it had a significantly improved driving performance. Powered by two Cadillac engines at the rear, the maximum speed of the T55E1 was 80 kilometers per hour or 50 miles per hour.\n\nThe single T55E1 GMC prototype was completed in early 1943 and underwent testing at the desert proving grounds of Fort Irwin in California. In the same year the Army decided that all self-propelled gun designs would be based on tracked tank chasses rather than on wheeled chasses. As such the T55E1 GMC project was dropped and it never entered production.\n\n=== [[wt:en/news/7057-development-battle-pass-vehicles-t55e1-wheeled-tank-destroyer-en|Devblog]] ===\nThe American T55E1 wheeled tank destroyer was created on the chassis of an experimental all-terrain 8x8 vehicle. The Cook Brothers company received an order for the development of the project in August 1942, and in the fall, the first prototype, named the T55, was ready at the Allied Machinery Manufacturing facility. After the first tests, the military suggested that the designers modify the vehicle, since some issues appeared during the tests. So, at the beginning of 1943, the T55E1 appeared - a more densely assembled and improved version of a promising self-propelled gun.\n\nThe T55E1 role in combat was assumed as fire support of advancing infantry, while being able to operate on any type of surface. The T55E1 had no turret, and the massive 76 mm M7 gun was located on the front of the vehicle. This arrangement required the shifting of the power plant of two 110-horsepower engines to the vehicle's rear. At the same time, the SPG received a low profile, sufficient traverse angles and excellent elevation angles. The upgraded T55E1, due to improved driving characteristics and a decrease in total weight, showed a speed of just over 50 mph (80 kph) in tests and good results in overcoming obstacles. At the same time in 1943, a special commission recommended that the army completely abandon the use of armoured wheeled vehicles in favor of tracked platforms, and the Cook Brothers project was closed. But we are sure that this curious tank destroyer will definitely find a place in War Thunder!\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=us_t55e1 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Images\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"175\">\nFile:T55E1 GMC WTWallpaper 01.jpg|\nFile:T55E1 GMC WTWallpaper 02.jpg|\nFile:T55E1 GMC WTWallpaper 03.jpg|\n</gallery>\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|9ffyPCaxp9k|'''Battle Pass Vehicles''' discusses the {{PAGENAME}} at 00:34 - ''War Thunder Official Channel''|y64g1ZhLc3c|'''The Battle Bonk Tonk - T55E1''' - ''JustinPlaysYT'' (Review starts at 1:15)}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n;Other vehicles of similar configuration and role\n* [[Breda 501]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wt:en/news/7057-development-battle-pass-vehicles-t55e1-wheeled-tank-destroyer-en|[Devblog] Battle Pass vehicles: T55E1 wheeled tank destroyer]]\n\n{{USA tank destroyers}}\n{{USA premium ground vehicles}}\n[[Category:Wheeled ground vehicles]]"}}
