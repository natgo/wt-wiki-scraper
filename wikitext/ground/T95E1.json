The APFSDS shell has more than enough power to destroy most tanks that it will face; however, on a uptier against [[Leopard A1A1]]'s, [[T-62M-1]]'s, and generally any 8.7 to 9.0 MBT, you will need to play more cautiously, thus the ambushing tactics come into play. You must be extremely aware of what is around you and be quicker than your enemy on the gun because the lack of stabilizers will make shooting on the move very difficult.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness.

If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block \"/History\" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->\nIn the early 1950s, the US began looking for a replacement for the M48 series.  In September 1954, the T95 was selected for development; construction of pilot models began in 1957.  The T95E1 differed from the T95 in the inclusion of a recoil system mount and the omission of a two-plane stabilizer, and was completed in early 1958.\n\nThe T95 program was shut down in July 1960 when it became clear that both the engine power and smoothbore cannon's accuracy were unsatisfactory and would provide no significant improvements over the M48 already in service.  However, further development of the turret design contributed significantly to the turret used later on the M60A1.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=us_t95e1 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n== See also ==\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wt:en/news/4752-t95e1-the-contender-en|[Devblog] T95E1: The Contender]]\n\n{{USA medium tanks}}"}}
