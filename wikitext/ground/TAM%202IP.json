In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium rank {{Specs|rank}} German light tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update \"Red Skies\"]]. Sitting between the [[TAM]] and [[TAM 2C]] in terms of performance, this tank is essentially an earlier TAM model with access to more modern ammunition and add-on armour for increased protection.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->\nBase armour of the TAM 2IP is very thin, just an 11 mm plate angled at 74° on the upper frontal glacis, and 15 mm of armour on the sides. Turret is not something to boast about either - the strongest plate being a gun mantlet with a 30 mm plate and sides being 25 mm thin.\n\nOn the bright side, the 2IP version is fitted with Iron Wall add-on composite armour. This variable thickness armour package dramatically increases effectiveness of armour against chemical munitions, but does little to protect against kinetic penetrators.\n\n'''Front'''\n\nMost noticeable increase in protection is on the upper plate of the hull - even newer HEAT rounds and older ATGMs may struggle to penetrate the hull armour. Sadly, add-on protection on the turret is not enough to defeat those same munitions. Frontal arc protection against autocannons is mostly great, but occasional lucky shots can penetrate the turret ring.\n\nPlayers also must be aware of the giant weak spot that is the driver's area - it is only 11 mm plate angled at 74° and it is not protected by add-on armour, allowing vehicles like [[Dardo]] to get through.\n\n'''Sides'''\n\nWhile the TAM 2IP is now resistant to 12.7 mm rounds on the hull side, overall side protection remains poor, as it can still get easily penetrated by anything larger than 12.7 mm.\n\n'''Crew'''\n\nWhen looking at the TAM 2IP from the front, one can see that on the left side, the commander sits directly behind the gunner, while the loader sits almost directly behind the driver on the right side.\n\nBoth gunner and commander are protected by the transmission and the engine ([[Merkava (Family)|similar to Merkava tanks]]); while that won't protect them from most kinetic munitions, it can negate shrapnel from older chemical and HESH rounds that manages to get through add-on armour.\n\nThe driver is very vulnerable as he sits behind an 11 mm thin plate angled at 74°, with a first-stage ammo rack and loader directly behind him. Driver's area is not protected by add-on armour either.\n\n'''Armour type:'''\n\n* Rolled homogeneous armour\n* Add-on composite armour\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Armour !!

This mobility allows the TAM 2IP to perform many different roles, be it flanking, scouting, rushing favourable positions or relocating.\n\n{{tankMobility|abMinHp=1116|rbMinHp=637}}\n\n=== Modifications and economy ===\n{{Specs-Economy}}\n\nAs a premium vehicle, the TAM 2IP comes with all modifications unlocked.\n\n== Armaments ==\n{{Specs-Tank-Armaments}}\n=== Main armament ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Weapon|1}}\n<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun.

Unlike TAM however, it has access to DM33, a very potent round at its BR. The TAM 2IP also comes equipped with a laser rangefinder - this gadget allows it to quickly acquire a target's distance, thus allowing long range shots immensely fast.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"100%\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" | [[FMK.4 Modelo 1L (105 mm)|105 mm FMK.4 Modelo 1L]] || colspan=\"5\" | Turret rotation speed (°/s) || colspan=\"4\" | Reloading rate (seconds)\n|-\n!

Unlike kinetic penetrators, it has one downside: given that it is a chemical round, its fuse is highly sensitive. With the emergence of composite and reactive armour, it quickly became obsolete in the anti-tank role. Requires careful aiming to properly damage newer tanks, though it can hold its own while fighting older tanks, lighter vehicles and low-flying helicopters.\n* '''DM502 HESH''' - This round was always plagued by a plethora of problems: low velocity, low penetration, inconsistent mechanics and sensitive fuse make this round gimmicky at best. That being said, with the overpressure mechanic, this round can be used in CQB against light vehicles with devastating effect.\n* '''DM23 APFSDS''' - This round allows the player to engage modern tanks more reliably, since it performs better against composite and reactive armour. While penetration is sufficient relative to the TAM 2IP's BR, there is simply no use for this round as its direct upgrade is available from the get go.\n* '''DM33 APFSDS''' - Best round available to the TAM 2IP and third best NATO round available for 105 mm cannons. It allows the player to engage '''any''' enemies at the TAM 2IP's BR at any range reliably. Even higher BR vehicles are not safe. Player should be of note that this round can easily over penetrate light vehicles such as BMP-2 or SPAAGs, so aiming at vital components is preferred in order to create shrapnel necessary to destroy them.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"100%\"\n! colspan=\"8\" | Penetration statistics\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" data-sort-type=\"text\" | Ammunition\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Type of<br>warhead\n! colspan=\"6\" | Penetration @ 0° Angle of Attack (mm)\n|-\n! 10 m !! 100 m !! 500 m !! 1,000 m !! 1,500 m !! 2,000 m\n|-\n| DM12 || HEATFS || 400 || 400 || 400 || 400 || 400 || 400\n|-\n| DM502 || HESH || 127 || 127 || 127 || 127 || 127 || 127\n|-\n| DM23 || APFSDS || 337 || 335 || 330 || 322 || 314 || 306\n|-\n| DM33 || APFSDS || 408 || 405 || 398 || 389 || 379 || 370\n|-\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"100%\"\n! colspan=\"10\" | Shell details\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" data-sort-type=\"text\" | Ammunition\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Type of<br>warhead\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Velocity<br>(m/s)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Projectile<br>Mass (kg)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Fuse delay<br>(m)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Fuse sensitivity<br>(mm)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Explosive Mass<br>(TNT equivalent) (g)\n! colspan=\"3\" | Ricochet\n|-\n! 0% !! 50% !! 100%\n|-\n| DM12 || HEATFS || 1,173 || 10.5 || 0.05 || 0.1 || 1,270 || 65° || 72° || 77°\n|-\n| DM502 || HESH || 732 || 14.85 || 0.1 || 4 || 4,310 || 73° || 77° || 80°\n|-\n| DM23 || APFSDS || 1,455 || 3.79 || N/A || N/A || N/A || 78° || 80° || 81°\n|-\n| DM33 || APFSDS || 1,455 || 3.79 || N/A || N/A || N/A || 78° || 80° || 81°\n|-\n|}\n\n==== [[Ammo racks]] ====\n[[File:Ammoracks_{{PAGENAME}}.png|right|thumb|x250px|[[Ammo racks]] of the {{PAGENAME}}]]\n<!-- '''Last updated: 2.7.0.173''' -->\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\nWhile the TAM 2IP can still perform well as a regular main battle tank, using it this way would be just wasting its potential. It's a fast, potent flanker, but with the addition of a powerful DM33 round, the TAM 2IP is also a potent sniper.\n\n'''Sniping:'''\n\nPlayers should abuse the TAM 2IP's mobility to reach advantageous positions and start picking off players. DM33 highly effective (only [[T-62M-1]] providing better performance) and coupled with laser range finder, the TAM 2IP can snipe really well. While it can't fight as well in hull down positions as Leopard A1A1 due to slightly worse gun depression, it can still make great use of cover, as it negates its biggest weakness - armour. Use the TAM 2IPs fast speed to get to a good position where you won't be seen and a lot of enemies will pass by. Start picking them off with your round and relocate after a couple of shots.\n\n'''Flanking:'''\n\nDue to the TAM 2IPs excellent mobility, stabilised gun and powerful round, the TAM 2IP is a potent flanker. Add-on armour allows it to shrug off most autocannon fire from IFVs, as those will be common flankers at this BR. Coupled with scouting ability, a TAM 2IP employing hit and run tactics on flanks can become the enemy team's worst nightmare.\n\n'''CQB:'''\n\nWhile the TAM 2IP performs great at longer ranges, its performance is below average on CQC maps with corridors and streets that do not allow it to exploit its mobility, like those found on Advance to Rhine. Better armoured tanks in general outperform the TAM 2IP by wide margin in these environments. Players should focus on ambushing enemy tanks. The TAM 2IP's turret placement on the back of the tank and acceleration can be exploited in this scenario well - by reversing out of cover, your engine is still protected while you expose only a small part of your tank. Another viable option is to support their allies. Let them take a shot, and as soon as you see the enemy tank return fire, lunge forward and send the enemy back to the garage.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness.
