In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' (shortened to '''{{Specs|pseudonym}}''', English translated as: ''Argentinian Medium Tank'') is a rank {{Specs|rank}} German light tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.81 \"The Valkyries\"]].\n\nIt's one of the best tanks Germany has to offer at this battle rating, with slightly better mobility than the A1A1 and the ability to scout. The minimal armour and overpressure vulnerability are downsides. Similar to the A1A1, it struggles when stock but holds its own very nicely once APFSDS is unlocked.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->\nThe armour is composed of welded steel, providing protection up to 32 mm. The front can defend against 12.7 mm machine gun ammo, but the side armour is only proof against standard machine guns of 7.62 mm. However, most enemies that can be faced will usually have a 12.7 mm machine gun or larger in their possession, making it so even a burst of bullets could riddle the TAM with holes. With this in mind, take caution when flanking a tank with a disabled gun to get a side shot, as you can easily lose a few crew members to machine gunfire. This becomes less of an issue after unlocking the APFSDS round when side shots are rarely as necessary. The TAM also is vulnerable to overpressure, so large-calibre HE rounds have a chance of instantly destroying the vehicle.\n\n'''Armour Type:'''\n\n* Rolled Homogeneous Armour (hull, turret)\n* Cast Homogeneous Armour (gunner periscope)\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

This comes with a drawback though; the TAM has very little to speak of in terms of armour. Nearly every shot will penetrate the armour. Heavy machine gun rounds can even penetrate the side of the tank, and aircraft with cannons or machine guns are a great threat. Many autocannons from tanks or SPAAGs are able to penetrate the TAM from the front, although the steep slope of the upper glacis is able to bounce rounds.\n\nDM23 APFSDS can penetrate most - if not all - enemies that can be faced by the TAM, making it the main ammunition choice of most TAM commanders. Despite having access to a decently powerful APFSDS round, there is more ammunition that should be considered. The DM12 HEATFS round has a penetration of 400 mm - enough to penetrate anything but composite armour or ERA. The DM502 HESH round is probably the least useful of the ammunition choices, due to it being situational. It can be useful, but will often have trouble penetrating the front of enemy tanks; it is best used to hit the roof of a tank to splash down into the crew compartment. The M416 smoke round, while nearly useless against enemy tanks, can be incredibly useful in the right situation. It can be used to lay down visual cover for teammates or the TAM itself, to blind the enemy, or to lay a path to a well defended capture point. The -7° of gun depression is usable, but the commander must be careful not to put the TAM in a position where it has insufficient gun depression to fire without exposing too much of the tank.\n\n'''Playstyle'''\n\nDue to its characteristics, the TAM is a very versatile tank. The flanking and scouting gameplay style uses all the advantages of the TAM, while negating the disadvantages, making it one of the best ways to drive the TAM. The TAM's high mobility allows it to assume strong, advanced positions before the enemy expects it to. From there, the scouting ability and powerful armament can be used to mark enemy tanks on the map for friendly tankers to be aware of, or to annihilate them tanks from the side or front. It can do this either by sniping from longer ranges or by ambushing at closer ranges. The versatile ammunition selection allows practically any enemy tank to be engaged effectively from any angle. In closer range areas of a map, the TAM can use its high mobility to hit the enemy where they don't expect it or before they expect it. Hit and run tactics are good because it helps to prevent the enemy from honing in on the TAM's location to knock it out. Due to the low armour of the TAM, the best way to ensure survival is to not be hit. This is why ambushes, sniping, or flanking are the safest and most successful tactics, although aggressive pushes can work as well. Overall, the heavy firepower, scouting ability, and good mobility allow the TAM to be successful in any sort of map or situation. Be aware the TAM lacks gunner or commander's sight NVD.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics.

After obtaining some vehicles, the U.S. refused to make further vehicle sales. This forced Argentina to shift their attention towards the European market, resulting in the purchase of a number of French AMX-13s and its variants.\n\nIn 1973 however, the Ministry of Defense drew up a set of requirements for a completely new combat vehicle that would be produced domestically and would to enter service by 1980. Despite knowing what they wanted, Argentinian engineers lacked the technical know-how in order to actually design and produce such a vehicle. Faced with this problem, the Argentinian government sought collaboration with a foreign company in order to design and build the vehicle they wanted. Eventually, a contracted was signed with the German Thyssen-Henschel company, a joint development effort soon ensued.\n\nThe TAM (Tanque Argentino Mediano, eng: Argentinian Medium Tank), as it would be designated, was based off the German Marder IFV and equipped with a modification of the British, the Royal Ordnance L7A3 cannon that was produced in Germany. The first two prototypes of the TAM were built in 1976 and 1977 respectively and underwent extensive testing over the course of two years.\n\nAfter successfully passing testing, the TAM was put into mass production in 1979. The vehicles were armed with FMK.4 Modelo 1L cannons, which was a domestic licensed copy of the original German cannon. The government ordered 200 vehicles of the IFV variant. However, economic difficulties resulted in the order being only partially fulfilled before production was restarted later on. Argentina was also very keen on exporting the TAM to other countries, but despite interest and some contracts being signed, the TAM was never widely exported for various reasons.\n\nA total of around 280 TAMs were built and most of them still serve in the Argentinian army, albeit with upgraded equipment. The TAM was never deployed in any combat operations to this date.\n\n''- From [[wt:en/news/5740-development-tam-replacing-the-old-guard-en|Devblog]]''\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=germ_thyssen_henschel_tam Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Images\n<gallery mode=\"packed-hover\"  heights=\"200\">\nFile:TAM.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|1Y935Ei_pBg|'''{{PAGENAME}} - Never Taken Lightly''' - ''JustinPlaysYT''|RGFSkEdQcTg|'''TAMing The Enemy Team - New BR Causes Sealclubbing''' - ''Napalmratte''|XvCqay-RaPQ|'''The Shooting Range #123''' - ''Pages of History'' section at 05:10 discusses the {{PAGENAME}}.}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n;Other vehicles of similar configuration and role\n* [[Leopard 1 (Family)]]\n* [[CV 90105 TML]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wt:en/news/5740-development-tam-replacing-the-old-guard-en|[Devblog] TAM - Replacing The Old Guard]]\n* [[wt:en/news/5714-development-tam-and-m247-sergeant-york-en|[Devblog] TAM and M247 Sergeant York]]\n* [[wikipedia:Tanque_Argentino_Mediano|[Wikipedia] Tanque Argentino Mediano]]\n* [https://tanks-encyclopedia.com/coldwar/argentina/tanque_argentino_mediano.php <nowiki>[Tanks Encyclopedia]</nowiki> Tanque Argentino Mediano (TAM)]\n\n{{TankManufacturer Thyssen-Henschel}}\n{{Germany light tanks}}"}}
