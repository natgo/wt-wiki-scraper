In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Israeli medium tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update \"Danger Zone\"]].\n\nThe representation of captured Arab T-54 in Israeli service, Tiran 4 provides the same firepower and mobility of a T-54 while still suffering from the same cramped interior space, downgraded anti-aircraft machine gun, unprotected ammo racks, and slow turret traverse speed.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->\nSince the Tiran 4 is mostly identical to the original T-54s other than its machine guns, the overall appearance is basically the same as well. While the armour is sufficient to stop most full-calibre kinetic shells, it might not be enough to survive HEAT, APDS, or even APFSDS at higher tiers. Another problem is the unprotected ammo rack located on the right side of the hull, any penetrating shots that hit the remaining ammo will certainly blow the tank sky-high.\n\n'''Armour type:'''\n* Rolled homogeneous armour (Hull)\n* Cast homogeneous armour (Turret)\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

While the reliability of these tanks was proven throughout the conflicts, during the 1967 Six-Day War and the sequential Yom Kippur War in 1973, Israel captured at least 300 T-54/55/62 series tanks during these two wars to resupply their heavily devastated armoured corps, dubbed \"Tiran\" (lit. \"Tyrant\") in Israeli service. Captured tanks were dubbed Tiran 1/2/3 for T-54/55/62 respectively, while Tirans which received some logistic modification were designated Tiran 4/5/6 instead. Israel used some of these tanks with their original Egyptian markings to cause harassment behind enemy lines along the Suez Canal.<ref>https://www.upi.com/Archives/1986/08/10/Israeli-division-of-captured-Soviet-tanks/7901524030400/</ref>\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=il_tiran_4 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n* [[T-54/55 (Family)]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n=== References ===\n<references />\n\n{{TankManufacturer Israeli Ordnance Corps}}\n{{Israel medium tanks}}"}}
