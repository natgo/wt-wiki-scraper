In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Israeli medium tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update \"Wind of Change\"]]. \n\nIt is a captured [[T-54 (1951)]] from the 1967 and 1973 Arab-Israeli Wars. The Tiran 4S offers the major change of switching to the American M68 cannon which is shared by other Israeli tanks. Beside that, the changes are minimal: from the outside, an added jerry can and rear stowage boxes, and the commander-controlled machine gun being swapped to a 7.62 mm M1919A4. \n\nIt plays similarly to the Soviet [[T-54 (1951)]] and Chinese [[type 59]], and is therefore not vulnerable to the shot-traps of earlier models. However, the new gun grants unique gunplay options with options for APDS, HESH, HEAT and Smoke shells. It will offer a fresh experience compared to the Soviet and Chinese T-54s.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->\nBeing a near perfect copy of the [[T-54 (1951)]], the Tiran 4S offers very good protection. It is able to survive all solid shot rounds, but offers no protection against HEAT-based options, leaving it weak in that aspect, especially at its battle rating where this type of ammunition is the norm.\n\n'''Armour type:'''\n\n* Rolled homogeneous armour (hull, turret, cupola)\n* Cast homogeneous armour (gun mantlet)\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
