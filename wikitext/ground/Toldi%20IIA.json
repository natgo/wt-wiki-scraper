In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium gift rank {{Specs|rank}} Italian light tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced during [[Update \"Ixwa Strike\"]] as a reward for [[Battle Pass: Season III, \"Strength athletics\"]].\n\nThe Toldi IIA is a light tank of the Landsverk L-60 family, a license-built Hungarian variant of the [[Strv m/38]], sporting a 40 mm 37/42M gun and better armour which allows it to stands its ground, but shares the same weaknesses as its Swedish counterpart.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->\n\nThe hull of the Toldi IIA is practically identical to the [[strv m/40L]]'s one. It is a very resistant hull at this battle rating, able to bounce back several rounds if angled correctly. In terms of survivability, this vehicle does not perform well: ammo racks are positioned on the sides of the hull, which is a benefit against frontal shots but a disadvantage against side shots. The crew compartment is tight, a well-aimed shot in the  center of the vehicle will knock it right out.\n\n'''Armour type:'''\n\n* Rolled homogeneous armour\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Armour !!

Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->\n\nThe Büssing NAG L8V/36TR is an engine capable of delivering 155 horsepower and manages to take the Toldi IIA to a top speed of 47 km/h. Unfortunately, the reverse is not as good, at only -5 km/h. This engine manages to make the Toldi IIa maintain a constant speed of at least 35 km/h on any terrain. The chassis is great for driving on all types of terrain that can be found in the game: sand, snow, mud and dirt.\n\n{{tankMobility|abMinHp=240|rbMinHp=137}}\n\n=== Modifications and economy ===\n{{Specs-Economy}}\n\n== Armaments ==\n{{Specs-Tank-Armaments}}\n=== Main armament ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Weapon|1}}\n<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun.

With its good speed, it can change positions effectively and quickly and with its decent mobility, it can afford to go and capture points first. With the limited protection of Toldi IIA, it is recommended to adopt a playstyle more focused on spotting enemies and supporting fire for allies. But for more dynamic players, it can be used as a frontline vehicle to capture the points in the first line and help the advance of allies.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness.

However, like Germany, this ban didn't hold Hungary back for long. After purchasing small batches of Italian and German tanks, the Hungarian government announced its intention to select a foreign tank design to be deployed at domestic facilities. As a result of tests, preference was given to the Swedish light tank Landsverk L-60, which later entered service with Sweden under the designation Strv m/38. The tank was adapted to the types of guns and sights available to Hungary, the turret was slightly modified and launched into series under the name 38.M Toldi. The first series of Hungarian light tanks, built before April 1940, actively participated in combat - including heavy battles on the Eastern Front, where it showed itself completely indefensible against Soviet medium and heavy armoured vehicles. After two modernizations, the protection on the gun mantlet and the frontal projection of the hull was strengthened, and the 40mm cannon became the main weapon. Now the tank was completely produced from Hungarian components, but with the increased protection and increased calibre, the weight of the vehicle also increased, which subsequently affected its movement performance. Despite all efforts, the upgraded 38.M Toldi II and IIA tanks could no longer compete with the Soviet tanks of the second half of the war. Almost all tanks in the series were lost in battles or by technical failures, the last Toldi were destroyed in the battles for Budapest. The only surviving 38.M Toldi IIA tank is currently on display in the Patriot park near Kubinka, Moscow region.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=it_toldi_II_a Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|EY-xuYT0xi8|'''Battle Pass: Strength Athletics''' discusses the {{PAGENAME}} at 00:33 - ''War Thunder Official Channel''}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n;Related development\n* [[Strv m/38]]\n* [[Strv m/39]]\n* [[Strv m/40L]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wt:en/news/7147-development-battle-pass-vehicles-38-m-toldi-iia-en|[Devblog] Battle Pass vehicles: 38.M Toldi IIA]]\n\n{{Italy light tanks}}\n{{Italy premium ground vehicles}}"}}
