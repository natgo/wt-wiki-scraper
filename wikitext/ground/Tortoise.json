In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} British tank destroyer {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.55 \"Royal Armour\"]] along with the initial British ground tree. A huge casemate structure made as an assault vehicle akin to the American's [[T95]], the Tortoise presents thick raw sloped armour with a unique heavy punching 94 mm cannon.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->\n\nThe Tortoise, as its name suggests, sacrifices speed to survivability.. With its cast 152 mm sloped armour, the Tortoise can survive most head on encounters. The area around the gun mantlet is 215 mm thick with a flat surface under the gunner's optics. It has a 55 mm plate (75°) under the gun and a 170 mm semi-rounded LFP. Sides are 152 mm thick. The engine deck's side armour is 101.6 mm thick with an asymmetry on the left. Rear armour is 100-110 mm thick flat plates. At this BR, there are not many tanks that can penetrate such thick material from the front. If used correctly, this vehicle should only get out of battles with a few 75, 88 and 122 mm scratches.\n\nIf, by any chance, an enemy gets through this massive steel casing, there is no less than 7 spaced out crew members to soak up damage. Most of the time, the AA gunner's cupola gets penetrated, since it is only 100 mm flat armour. AP (and APDS) shells will only disable the AA defences while any APHE shell may incapacitate the driver and 1 or 2 loaders. If unlucky, it will detonate the massive ammo rack lying on the floor. Another common angle of attack is the machine gunner's port. Once again, AP shots will knock-out 2-3 non-essential crew members (machine gunner, commander, loader) and APHE shells may even eliminate the gunner. Sometimes, when getting too exposed, the 170 mm almost flat LFP gets shot at. This will usually disable the gunner, transmission and even ignite an ammo rack if there's enough explosive. A few highly penetrating tanks may shoot through the flat 215 mm surface underneath the gunner's optics. This usually means an instant knock-out for the Tortoise if it happens to be an [[IS-2]], [[Tiger II (H)|Tiger II (H)]] since there are ammo racks all around the gunner. Any penetrating hit to the side usually means an instant elimination (if not immediate, the following shot should be the last). The cannon barrel is often targeted by players: its large and thin muzzle brake tends to be damaged easily. Note that some large HE shells may tear through the top armour, wrecking havoc in the crew compartment.\n\n'''Armour type:'''\n\n* Cast homogeneous armour\n* Rolled homogeneous armour (Side hull, Rear hull, Hull roof, Superstructure roof)\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!

With a max speed of 20 km/h in both directions, neutral steering and wide tracks, this tank has good enough mobility to get into position and fire on the enemy. It is not advised to travel up to the frontlines since it will only expose weak spots, make flanking easier, and take a really long time due to poor max speed.\n\n=== Modifications and economy ===\n{{Specs-Economy}}\n\n== Armaments ==\n{{Specs-Tank-Armaments}}\n=== Main armament ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Weapon|1}}\n<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun.

Fortunately, these large calibre rounds are roughly similar to [[20pdr OQF Mk.I (84 mm)|20-pounder cannon's]] APDS, meaning the learning curve from the [[Charioteer Mk VII]] is not too steep.

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\nThe A39 Tortoise was created with the intention of serving as a \"heavy assault tank\" to break through the Siegfried Line. It plays more as a tank destroyer that's best used at long range. Therefore, to maximize the potential of the Tortoise, one must stay at long distances and snipe enemies with the very accurate [[Ordnance QF 32-pounder (94 mm)|32 pdr OQF]] cannon, while making sure to choose good cover, so as to not allow the enemy to target the Tortoise's weak spots: the MG turret and gunner's cupola, the flat areas of the mantlet armour, and the lower front plate (LFP) if it is left exposed. With its slow speed and reload rate, this is not a frontline tank; it will easily be outflanked if used in shorter range engagements. In summary, the Tortoise is best used in a defensive capacity - either to defend capture points, or important strategic areas on the map (i.e. areas where enemies love to camp).\n\nThe Tortoise is a true sniper tank destroyer: the farther, the better. Its biggest vulnerability is that it moves extremely slowly, so it's not recommended for frontline combat. It plays much better as an entrenched shooter that can change a game by picking cover with a good field of fire, and then denying enemy entry or egress of an area. The cannon lacks an AP shell  with HE filler, making general knowledge of tank internals a must. With good gun depression, it can be near-invincible when taking a good hull-down position, and can retreat back into cover easily enough due to its good reverse speed.\n\nSome tips for specific combat environments:\n\n;Plains\n\nThis type of terrain is mostly devoid of any structures that could possibly provide cover. The terrain itself will provide the main form of cover. Maps such as [[Kursk (Ground Forces)|Kursk]], [[Mozdok (Ground Forces)|Mozdok]] and [[Jungle]] can be described as such. Find decent cover that provides a good view of the battlefield and field of fire, then set up a kill zone to deny entry into an area. Scout with binoculars so as to not needlessly expose yourself, then pop out at the right time to fire at any worthwhile targets of opportunity. Overextend tactics work well with this tank: line up a shot, take it, and fall back behind cover. Do not bother to move from a good position if possible: the Tortoise can take many shots before going down, and its dreadful top speed make it counterintuitive to play in an offensive capacity. Reposition the tank only if the enemy line gets too close or if there is a flanker in the vicinity.\n\n;Urban\n\nThese kind of grounds are all about buildings, terrain variation is almost nonexistent. Maps such as [[Abandoned_Factory_(Ground_Forces)|Abandoned Factory]], [[Port Novorossiysk]] and [[Advance to the Rhine]] are urban battlefields. This is the most tricky scenario to face with the Tortoise. Pick an alley and cover it from one end or ambush near a capture point, if feeling lucky. Always try to stay near allied cover.\n\n;Rural\n\nRural maps are a mix of the two former: a small urban map surrounded by plains. Maps such as [[Fields of Poland]], [[Eastern Europe (Ground Forces)|Eastern Europe]] and [[Normandy (Ground Forces)|Normandy]] are rural environments. Stay around the town and never get in, cover alleys from afar, make the enemy fear to turn any corner. Try to get as far as possible to the town and keep an eye for flankers.\n\n;Hilly terrain\n\nThese maps feature high terrain deformation with steep hills and even walls. Maps such as [[Ash River]], [[Karelia]] and [[Frozen Pass]] falls under this designation. Use the same tactics as with plains while being extra careful since flanking is easier on these kind of maps. Stick to the rear of allied armour or play as a bullet magnet, leaving light tanks a way to flank the enemy without getting too much attention. Make sure to hide weak spots behind props such as rocks or walls, leaving only the gun mantlet exposed.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as \"bad\", \"good\" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as \"inadequate\" and \"effective\".'' -->\n\n'''Pros:'''\n\n* Good frontal armour and adequately thick side armour \n* Angling the tank at near-45 degrees increases protection\n* 94 mm 32-pdr OQF cannon offers both high penetration power and post-penetration spalling damage\n* Highest penetrating round (Shot Mk. 1 APCBC) has a forgiving and predictable trajectory\n* 7-man crew means that it will usually take several HEAT or APDS rounds to knock out the Tortoise (even penetrating APHE shells likely will not destroy the tank in a single hit)\n* Goes as fast in reverse as it does when travelling forward\n\n'''Cons:'''\n\n* Given its enormous size, the tank is nearly impossible to fully conceal.\n* Lack of speed and manoeuvrability: it is extremely slow given its enormous weight. You will not be able to run away from threats.\n* The Tortoise lacks AP shells with any explosive filler. However, unlike most other British tanks at this battle rating, no APDS shells are available for the 32-pounder.\n* Obvious weak spot: The MG turret on top of the tank is massive and is weakly armoured, which players will readily take advantage of: if an APHE round were to penetrate, it would likely kill the loader (and possibly the driver).\n* The top left corner of the tank is big and flat; APHE rounds with high penetration can punch right through, killing the commander and gunner.\n* Due to the casemate design, cover and fields of fire must be chosen carefully to minimize exposition of the Tortoise's weaknesses.\n* The lower front plate (LFP) is somewhat flat and presents a possible weak spot for enemies to shoot at if exposed.\n\n== History ==\n<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction.

This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->\n===Development===\nYears before the invasion of Normandy, there were men among the Allied planners worrying about the heavily-defended fortification lines such as the Siegfried Line blocking the path from France to Germany. One of the proposed methods was to develop extremely heavily armoured vehicles capable of destroying any fortification it comes across and any resistance the German had. Britain and America both worked on this project in order to develop these super-heavy tanks.\n\nThe British began to develop a new type of vehicle to counter this threat, the Assault Tanks that focuses all effort on armour. The first development for such a tank began in 1943 as the [[Excelsior|A33 Excelsior]] tank, though this was cancelled with better reliability of the [[Churchill Mk VII|Churchill infantry tank]]. The Secretary of State for War and the Minister of Supply sent out specifications for the Assault Tanks in April 1943, to which the Nuffield Organisation react with 18 designs for the specifications between May 1943 to February 1944, named ''AT1'' to ''AT18''. Each design was more armoured than its predecessor, but design ''AT16'' was approved by the Tank Board in February 1944. It was proposed that 25 vehicles would be produced and thus work began throughout the rest of the war. Six units were produced before production came to an end.\n\n===Design===\nThe ''AT16'' was renamed the '''A39 Tortoise Heavy Assault Tank''' during its production life. The Tortoise is a fixed casemate design. Though classified as an Assault Tank, it was in reality a self-propelled/assault gun. The fixed casemate superstructure limited the gun traverse, but the front armour is very thick at 225 mm. This large amount of armour came at the increased weight of 80 tons and a height of 10 feet. The gun is the 96 mm 32-pounder gun that provided effective explosive and armour-piercing capabilities, good enough to destroy a [[Panther G|Panther]] tank at 1,000 yards away. The Tortoise is powered by a Meteor engine with an all-speed transmission system for equal speed forward and reverse. The suspension is a bogie system, with each bogie having a pair of wheels that are linked to a transverse torsion bar. The vehicle holds a crew of six people, two of which are loaders for the 32-pounder gun.\n\n===Cancellation===\nBy the time the few prototypes of the vehicles were made, World War II in Europe ended in May 1945. The rapid demilitarization and lack of need for such a vehicle reduced the original order amount to just 6 vehicles, which were built. One was sent to Germany for evaluation trials, where the Tortoise proved itself as being mechanically reliable and its 32-pounder a great asset on the battlefield. Its undoing was its 80 ton weight, which gave it a low speed and a logistical nightmare to transport around the region.\n\nIn the end, the super heavy tanks designs made by the Americans ([[T28]]) and the British (Tortoise) only proved that such needs for tanks were unnecessary. The Siegfried Line and other such fortifications were taken out by use of the standard issued medium tanks such as the [[M4|M4 Shermans]], proving that affordable, mass-produced vehicles could dominate the modern battlefield. The only positive note that these heavy tanks provided was that it showed the true extent of American and British industrial capabilities, being able to produce these massive monsters.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=uk_a39_tortoise Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|-WGV2ECr-TA|'''The Shooting Range #252''' - ''Metal Beasts'' section at 00:25 discusses the {{PAGENAME}}.|B2woWvJK4ew|'''Top 7 most armoured vehicles'''  discusses the {{PAGENAME}} at 0:18  - ''War Thunder Official Channel''|FafvSJDEfwA|'''Tank Chats #15 Tortoise''' - ''The Tank Museum''}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!--''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''-->\n\n* [[T28]] / [[T95]]\n\n== External links ==\n''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.''\n\n{{TankManufacturer Nuffield}}\n{{Britain tank destroyers}}"}}
