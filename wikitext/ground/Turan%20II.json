As previously noted, slight angling can increase the effective armour of the Turan. The mesh side skirts give added protection against HEAT rounds. However, the armour overall is average for the BR. Playing the Turan conservatively can maximize survivability as the armour can be defeated by many other vehicles at this BR. The crew of five helps survivability, but they are somewhat close together, and the shells are placed all throughout the tank, including the turret, increasing the chances of getting ammo racked.\n\nThe Turan has deceptively good mobility for a tank of its size and armament. It has a decent acceleration and top speed, and a great reverse speed. The hull and turret traverse are both average. Using the Turan's mobility to find good flanking locations pairs well with its relatively quick reload and good gun depression. The 75 mm cannon has a lower velocity and three different shells. The HEAT shell is clearly the superior round with up to 90 mm of penetration at any range. The APHE can inflict more post-pen damage but at the cost of a drastic drop in penetration, less than half that of the HEAT round. The HE round doesn't have many practical uses, as the HEAT round often is sufficient to overpressure certain vehicles.\n\nA decent acceleration and top speed, and a great reverse speed.

After one test unit successfully passed initial trials in Hungary, several changes were made to the design, including the fitting of a Hungarian 40 mm cannon as well as increased armour protection. The resulting T-22 design would then be officially accepted into Hungarian service as the 40.M Turán in November 1940.\n[[File:Turan II History II.png|thumb|Turan II tanks before battle]]\nAn initial order of 230 Turán Is was issued in September 1940, but production ended up being delayed by several months due to incomplete technical documentation. Production started only in March 1941 after Škoda supplied the complete technical documents, with the first 40.M Turán I rolling off the assembly line in July 1941. However, before even the first vehicle was constructed, the Hungarian General Staff realized the need for upgrading the vehicle and thus formulated the specification to upgun the Turán with a 75mm gun. However, as no such gun could be developed by Hungary at the time, a WW1 field gun was selected to be modified for tank use.\n\nThis undertaking was successful, though it required the Turán's turret to be enlarged slightly. The first prototype of this modification, which became known as the 41.M Turán II, was built in January 1942 and entered service in May. In total, around 195 Turán IIs were constructed until 1944. Today, only a single example of the Turán II survives and is on display in the Kubinka Tank Museum in the vicinity of Moscow.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=it_41m_turan_2 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|WlS7yspnciI|'''Battle Pass: Firepower''' discusses the {{PAGENAME}} at 00:38 - ''War Thunder Official Channel''}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n* [[Toldi IIA]]\n* [[Pz.III N (Italy)]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wt:en/news/7524-development-battle-pass-vehicles-41-m-tur%C3%A1n-ii-en|[Devblog] Battle Pass vehicles: 41.M Turán II]]\n\n\n{{Italy medium tanks}}\n{{Italy premium ground vehicles}}"}}
