In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Japanese medium tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update \"Winged Lions\"]].\n\nAlso known as Hitomaru (''kun-yomi'' pronunciation of the number 10), the Type 10 MBT was initially accepted into service in 2010 (with effect in 2012) to replace or complement the existing Type 74 and Type 90 main battle tanks. Compared to its predecessors, there was a bigger emphasis on the {{Annotation|C4I system|command, control, communication, computer & intelligence}}, weight reduction, and modular armour.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->\nThe Type 10 was designed to be a lighter yet more protected version of its predecessor, the [[Type 90]] (Kyumaru); thanks to advances in technology during the two decades and its overall design, the Type 10 reaches a high level of protection with an detachable composite block on the front of the hull, the turret has also been designed to fit new composite armour blocks. The overall protection of the hull front can reach up to 575-580 mm against kinetic rounds on average, while the turret is another story - with only frontal arc protection and around 500 mm of KE protection, chances are most darts at the same BR range can penetrate the turret with relatively ease, and turret sidescraping is not an option as the inner part of the turret has very little protection.\n\nThe lower glacis is yet another story, with its fairly large area and very low protection, it can be the death sentence of the Type 10 if the spalling after penetration spreads in a wide area and does fatal damage to the crew.\n\nThe huge hull can mitigate some spalling from KE rounds thanks to its relatively hollow battle compartment, but having only 3 crew members like the [[Type 90]] means that a loss of 2 crew will result in a knock out.\n\n'''Armour type:''' <!-- The types of armour present on the vehicle and their general locations -->\n<!-- Example: * Rolled homogeneous armour (Front, Side, Rear, Hull roof)\n* Cast homogeneous armour (Turret, Transmission area) -->\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Another key feature is the 14 round autoloader that reloads every 4 seconds, located at the back of the turret, making Type 10 a very formidable opponent in battle.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"100%\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" | [[TKG (120 mm)|120 mm TKG]] || colspan=\"5\" | Turret rotation speed (°/s) || colspan=\"4\" | Reloading rate (seconds)\n|-\n!

At top tier, it struggles to penetrate any modern MBTs with composite armour with up to 900 mm CE protection and its explosive filler is nowhere near enough to overpressure any MBTs as well, just enough to ruin the day for lighter vehicles or SPAAGs. However, thanks to the Type 10's above average mobility, taking the flanks is still achievable; and the reload rate is forgiving for misplaced shots, players might still have a second chance to knock out the enemy's gun or the whole tank right away with its 4 second reload.\n\nThe first kinetic round is another familiar shell as well: JM33 APFSDS, equivalent of DM33, at tier I modification. Players who have experienced the Type 90 duo knows how the shell struggles when facing the masses of Soviet/Russian MBTs with sturdy front arc protection; only well-placed shots on their weak spots or lower glacis can knock them out. This is still far superior to the stock JM12A1, and should be a priority for research.\n\nThe final researchable shell is the brand new Type 10 APFSDS, which is also the latest shell of JGSDF that came commissioned with Type 10 itself. New technologies on this dart boost both its penetration and velocity - delivering a whopping 615 mm of penetration every 4 seconds can certainly be the nightmare of any tanks trying to break through the frontline.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"100%\"\n! colspan=\"8\" | Penetration statistics\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" data-sort-type=\"text\" | Ammunition\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Type of<br>warhead\n! colspan=\"6\" | Penetration @ 0° Angle of Attack (mm)\n|-\n! 10 m !! 100 m !! 500 m !! 1,000 m !! 1,500 m !! 2,000 m\n|-\n| JM12A1 || HEATFS || 480 || 480 || 480 || 480 || 480 || 480\n|-\n| JM33 || APFSDS || 481 || 478 || 470 || 461 || 450 || 440\n|-\n| Type 10 || APFSDS || 615 || 613 || 604 || 592 || 582 || 571\n|-\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"100%\"\n! colspan=\"10\" | Shell details\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" data-sort-type=\"text\" | Ammunition\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Type of<br>warhead\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Velocity<br>(m/s)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Projectile<br>Mass (kg)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Fuse delay<br>(m)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Fuse sensitivity<br>(mm)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Explosive Mass<br>(TNT equivalent) (g)\n! colspan=\"3\" | Ricochet\n|-\n! 0% !! 50% !! 100%\n|-\n| JM12A1 || HEATFS || 1,140 || 13.5 || 0.05 || 0.1 || 2,150 || 65° || 72° || 77°\n|-\n| JM33 || APFSDS || 1,640 || 4.3 || N/A || N/A || N/A || 78° || 80° || 81°\n|-\n| Type 10 || APFSDS || 1,780 || 4.2 || N/A || N/A || N/A || 78° || 80° || 81°\n|-\n|}\n\n==== [[Ammo racks]] ====\n<!-- [[File:Ammoracks_{{PAGENAME}}.png|right|thumb|x250px|[[Ammo racks]] of the {{PAGENAME}}]] -->\n<!-- '''Last updated:''' -->\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!

They share many similarities such as a high-power diesel engine and firepower, but the Type 10 also received vast upgrades in terms of protection and ammunition thanks to the advance in technology.\n\nTo handle a Type 10 to its greatest extent, players should keep in mind that speed is still their friend, but the UFP armour is also something that can be relied on thanks to its around 580 mm KE protection. Although it might not have the strongest frontal arc among top-tier tanks, this could help stop a few rounds, enhancing its survivability against its enemies. For less aggressive gameplay, Type 10 could find a ridge line and stay behind it, its gun depression and hydropneumatic suspension can further enhance its odds to survive against masses of enemies; while being aggressive is also viable, but players should keep in mind that the LFP is paper-thin in MBT standards, a well-placed shot can knock out multiple crew members, resulting in a kill for the enemy. Its tank gun with 4 second reload, superior FCS with one of the latest TVD sights and new Type 10 APFSDS certainly can be nightmares for groups of enemies trying to break through the line. Alternatively it could be a second-line tank for a group of tanks, its rate of fire certainly could save frontline players if they missed the chance to knock out an enemy with a single shot.\n\n;Notable Opponents \n\n* '''T-80BVM/T72B3''' - The Russian top-rank MBTs pose a dangerous opponent for the Type 10. They possess good firepower and frontal protection. Frontally, the player wants to aim at the lower plate or drivers port. If facing from the sides, be aware that the Russian ERA blocks may stop the shell (even one as powerful as the Type 10 APFSDS) and always note that it may take a follow-up shot to knock it out.\n\n* '''M1A2 Abrams''' - The M1A2 possesses good straight line mobility that rivals the Type 10 with superior protection and survivability. The player wants to aim at the massive turret ring, this will usually knock out or cripple the tank. Take a follow up shot if needed. If turret ring is not visible, the player wants to aim at the gun breech or mantlet to knock out the gun.\n\n* '''Challenger 2 E/F/TES/Black Knight''' - The Challenger 2 is slow, large target with subpar protection against top battle-rating kinetic munitions. Though players should still beware of its 5 second (with ace crew) reload that is almost as fast as the Type 10's (within its ready rack range). The player can aim at its lower plate, drivers port or breech area.\n\n* '''Leopard 2''' - Superior firepower and turret protection, these tanks have vulnerable hulls that are rather easy to penetrate with the Type 10 round. The player can aim lower plate. If the Leopard 2 is hull down - player can aim at the barrel or try to knock out the gun breech through a turret ring shot (Warning: Turret ring shots tend to be unreliable so be careful of the angle!)\n\n* '''Leclerc''' - Mobile autoloaded tanks with decent protection, the Leclerc(s) have a large weak spot in the breech area that can disable the gun or possibly knock out the tank.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness.

The possible rivals of Japan, like Mainland China and the Russia Federation had already developed their new MBTs (PLAGF [[ZTZ96 (Family)|ZTZ96]] and [[ZTZ99 (Family)|ZTZ99]]/Russian [[T-90A]]); in view of maintain a team of tank designers as well as a part of national defense, JGSDF passed a new plan for a next generation MBT with redundancy for further upgrades (modularity), thus inherited the project name: TK-X.\n[[File:JGSDF Type10 tank 2012-05-27.jpg|x350px|right|thumb|none|A JGSDF Type 10 at Camp Takeyama, Japan.]]\n==== From Kyumaru to Hitomaru ====\nThe TK-X project aimed for the light weight of a Type 74 (at 40 tons, loaded) while being smaller than Type 90, equipping a domestic 120 mm smoothbore gun with latest {{Annotation|C4ISR|Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance}} system, modular composite armour, and new engines paired with HMT transmission. TK-X was lead by Technical Research and Development Institute (防衛省技術研究本部; TRDI) with help from Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (三菱重工; MHI). The new smoothbore gun and its new APFSDS was developed by Nippon Steel Corporation (新日本製鐵) and Daikin Industries (ダイキン工業) respectively. These designs had been tested on a Tank Test Bed (TTB) developed from the 6th prototype of Type 90 and was first shown in a booklet in early 2000s; the result of TTB proved the designs and project TK-X started from 2002. The 1st prototype was assembled at November 2004 and tested at JGSDF Camp Higashi-Chitose (東千歳駐屯地); MHI built the 2nd prototype in 2005, while there were also 3 Type 90s converted as the test bed for tank platoon command systems.\n\nFinally, with the evaluations from JGSDF Fuji School (富士学校), Ordnance School (武器学校), and leaked photos of the 2nd prototype, TK-X was unveiled on 14 June 2010 to the public during the opening of JGSDF East Fuji Manoeuvre Area (東富士演習場) and it was then named Type 10 at October. It served as the most advanced MBT of the first decade of the 2000s, and is an icon of the JGSDF moving forward into the 21st century.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=jp_type_10 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|eb6Xlv-YJA0|'''The Shooting Range #285''' - ''Metal Beasts'' section at 00:51 discusses the {{PAGENAME}}.}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n;Related Development\n\n* [[Type 90 (Family)]] - <small>(predecessor)</small>\n\n;Other vehicles of similar configuration and role\n\n* [[Leclerc (Family)]]\n* [[M1 Abrams (Family)]]\n* [[Leopard 2 (Family)]]\n* [[Ariete (Family)]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wt:en/news/7448-development-type-10-making-the-good-better-en|[Devblog] Type 10: Making the good, better]]\n\n{{Japan medium tanks}}"}}
