It was introduced in [[Update 1.89 \"Imperial Navy\"]].\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->\nEven as a lightly armoured wheeled manoeuvrable combat vehicle, the Type 16 is still quite protected all-around against HE and chemical projectiles and can frontally stand up against AP up to roughly 130-150 mm penetration. This will provide enough defence against machine guns and autocannons but won't stand up against the common APFSDS shells that will be at this tier.\n\nFurther defence on the Type 16 will come in the form of smoke grenades, smoke shells, and a laser warning system providing intel on being targeted by a long-range tank readying up a shot which the driver can drive out of and lasers from helicopters setting up a missile that can be blocked by smoke.\n\n'''Armour type:'''\n* Rolled homogeneous armour\n* Composite screen (hull sides)\n* Wheel (tires)\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

It features the standard selection of APFSDS, HESH, HEAT-FS, and smoke, in addition to the Type 93 shell, one of the better APFSDS at this rank. While you will struggle against top-tier main battle tanks from the front, your gun is very effective against everything else. The HEAT-FS is especially effective against lightly armoured vehicles - it will often overpressure where the APFSDS will not deal sufficient damage.\n\nWhen fighting MBTs, you should try to get side on shots. The Type 93 APFSDS will struggle against most top-tier MBTs from the front, but from the side it will act like any other fin round. This is especially effective against \"T-series\" tanks like the T-64, T-72, and T-80.\n\n==== Ammunition ====\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"100%\"\n! colspan=\"8\" | Penetration statistics\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" data-sort-type=\"text\" | Ammunition\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Type of<br>warhead\n! colspan=\"6\" | Penetration @ 0° Angle of Attack (mm)\n|-\n! 10 m !! 100 m !! 500 m !! 1,000 m !! 1,500 m !! 2,000 m\n|-\n| Type 91 || HEATFS || 400 || 400 || 400 || 400 || 400 || 400\n|-\n| Type 75 || HESH || 127 || 127 || 127 || 127 || 127 || 127\n|-\n| M735 || APFSDS || 353 || 350 || 342 || 333 || 322 || 312\n|-\n| Type 93 || APFSDS || 405 || 403 || 396 || 388 || 378 || 370\n|-\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"100%\"\n! colspan=\"10\" | Shell details\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" data-sort-type=\"text\" | Ammunition\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Type of<br>warhead\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Velocity<br>(m/s)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Projectile<br>Mass (kg)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Fuse delay<br>(m)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Fuse sensitivity<br>(mm)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Explosive Mass<br>(TNT equivalent) (g)\n! colspan=\"3\" | Ricochet\n|-\n! 0% !! 50% !! 100%\n|-\n| Type 91 || HEATFS || 1,150 || 10.5 || 0.05 || 0.1 || 1,270 || 65° || 72° || 77°\n|-\n| Type 75 || HESH || 760 || 10.8 || 0.1 || 4 || 3,890 || 73° || 77° || 80°\n|-\n| M735 || APFSDS || 1,501 || 3.7 || N/A || N/A || N/A || 76° || 77° || 80°\n|-\n| Type 93 || APFSDS || 1,501 || 3.4 || N/A || N/A || N/A || 78° || 80° || 81°\n|-\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n! colspan=\"7\" | Smoke shell characteristics\n|-\n!

It also retains the roof mounted .50 calibre HMG in the American style; this can be extremely effective against light tanks, especially Soviet light tanks like the BMP-1, BMP-2, Object 906, and Object 685.

Refrain from creating a \"guide\" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\n'''General Playstyle'''\n\nLike most light tanks at top tier, you are extremely mobile and capable of pulling off some early flanking attacks on the enemy, weakening them and possibly slowing them down while your MBT allies crawl to your position and mop up any remaining enemy armour. Additionally, the Type 16 possesses an extremely good combination of optics: you have access to both thermals and night vision as well as a nice zoom of 4.0x all the way to 13.3x which makes it an excellent sniper. The Type 16 also provides you with a laser warning system/range finder combo package which makes it easier to tell if you have gained the attention of any enemy tanks during your expedition into the wilderness.\n\n'''Realistic Battles'''\n\nIn RB, it is best to use your speed either to flank the enemy in order to snipe and scout them or reach a nice camping spot in hopes of delaying their advance, ideally near a choke point in the map where they will be bunched up and find it hard to manoeuvre once they notice you, slowing them down just a little bit more. You serve a vital role in matches as any amount of time the enemy team spends dealing with you they also spend ignoring your allies and the capture points, delaying actions should be a priority even above killing as a dead tank can respawn and head elsewhere whereas you need to waste as much of their time as possible, knocking out engines and damaging tracks as well as scaring them via destroying their barrel (which almost always leads to the enemy running back behind friendly lines so they waste time prior to repairing) is all fair game, the more annoying you are the more likely your team will have the time needed to gain the upper hand and win. A final note, this vehicle can if needed brawl for a little while due to its lack of armour and the decently spaced crew layout but it should be your last resort both due to overpressure being an extreme danger and the fact that other light tanks like the BMP family will chew through the sides of the Type 16 with ease and quickly knock out the crew in close quarters. If at all possible, avoid brawling and use your speed to reposition and continue the fight at a distance. On city maps, try to run and get behind the enemy for quick ammo racks and engine fires.\n\n'''Arcade Battles'''\n\nIn AB, your ability to flank is hampered by the different visibility mechanics, so it may be best to put lots of obstacles such as buildings or terrain between you and any enemy tanks while driving around the map in order to avoid this issue until your ready to strike. If the map lacks such terrain features, then you can also resort to acting as a support vehicle and stay with your teammates, using them as armour and providing fire support in addition to providing help with repairing all the breaches that are often damaged during top tier battles. Finally, being a scout tank makes you rather ideal for air support so whenever possible (and when it's safe) use it to help out allies in other parts of the map, your tank is fast but it can't be in two places at once, the air units you bring in can fix that little problem and can provide the much needed assistance your allies were lacking leading to a higher chance of winning the match.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as \"bad\", \"good\" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as \"inadequate\" and \"effective\".'' -->\n\n'''Pros:'''\n\n* Excellent mobility\n* Same gun and general ammo choices as the NATO tanks\n* Powerful Type 93 APFSDS, which can deal frontally with most vehicles it faces with\n* Gen 3 thermals for both gunner and commander\n\n'''Cons:'''\n\n* Large profile\n* Other than frontal armour, relatively lightly-armoured\n* Side and rear can't withstand calibres above 12.7 mm\n* Really does not like to accelerate in mud, snow or off-road conditions\n\n== History ==\n<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block \"/History\" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template.

This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->\nIn the early 2000's, Japan sought to develop a new combat vehicle to extend the operational mobility of their armoured units. Furthermore, the new vehicle was supposed to counter the limitations of existing tracked vehicles, be able to rapidly respond to emerging threats in the event of an outbreak of hostilities and possess the ability to be airlifted or ocean transferred to more distant areas of operations, such as the Japanese island of Okinawa.\n\nThus, in 2007, engineers at Mitsubishi began development on what would become the Type 16 MCV. To satisfy all the requirements, it was clear from the onset that a lightly armoured, yet highly mobile and well-armed wheeled vehicle would need to be developed. Already, by 2008, the order for four prototypes was issued, with deliveries going on until 2013.\n\nArmy trials of the vehicle went on until 2016, when after successfully passing them, it officially entered service with the JSDF under the designation \"Type 16 MCV\". Production began in the same year (2016), and is still ongoing today. Presently, around 100 Type 16 MCVs have been built and commissioned into service, with no units seeing combat action thus far.\n\n''- From [[wt:en/news/6218-development-type-16-mcv-elite-marksman-en|Devblog]]''\n\n== Media ==\n<!--Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.-->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=jp_type_16 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n{{Skin-gallery\n |market|ugcitem_1000462|Type 16 digital camouflage.png|Camo \"Digital camouflage\"\n |market|ugcitem_1000462|Type 16 in two-tone deforming camouflage.png|Camo \"Two-tone deforming camouflage\"\n}}\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|chjZ6Hra--c|'''Best wheeled tanks''' discusses the {{PAGENAME}} at 01:03 - ''War Thunder Official Channel''|07oqg8OOJ2M|'''Type 16 vs Centauro ROMOR''' - ''War Thunder Official Channel''|jjanlLrycGo|'''The Shooting Range #156''' - ''Metal Beasts'' section at 00:39 discusses the Type 16.}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n;Other {{Annotation|MCV|Maneuver Combat Vehicle}}/{{Annotation|MGS|Mobile Gun System}}'s:\n\n* [[File:Italy_flag.png|20px|link=]] [[Centauro (Family)]]\n* [[File:South Africa_flag.png|20px|link=]] [[Rooikat (Family)]]\n* [[File:FRG_flag.png|20px|link=]] [[Radkampfwagen 90]]\n* [[File:USA_flag.png|20px|link=]] [[M1128]]\n* [[File:France_flag.png|20px|link=]] [[AMX-10RC]]\n* [[File:China_flag.png|20px|link=]] [[ZLT11]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wt:en/news/6218-development-type-16-mcv-elite-marksman-en|[Devblog] Type 16 MCV: Elite Marksman]]\n\n{{Japan light tanks}}\n[[Category:Wheeled ground vehicles]]"}}
