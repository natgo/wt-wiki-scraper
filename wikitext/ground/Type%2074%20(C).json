It was introduced in [[Update \"Direct Hit\"]].\n\nThe earliest of the production variant of the [[Type 74 (Family)|Type 74]], it has some of the early ammunition set for the 105 mm L7A3 cannon. The most distinctive difference between the {{PAGENAME}} and the next [[Type 74 (E)]] is the C version lacks the thermal shroud around the 105 mm L7A3 cannon (this feature was introduced in the Type 74 (D) variant).\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection.
