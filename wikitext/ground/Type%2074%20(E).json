While it's unlikely to stop most APFSDS, it is very likely to deflect stray APDS and APHE. Light tanks will likely have to get close and personal to penetrate it, as penetrating cupola even with APDS belt is a challenge due to its size.\n\nThe advantage can be kept even when creeping onto the enemy high ground by using hydropneumatic suspension before driving uphill to not allow the enemy to fire at the roof. In rare cases, the tank can \"duck\" behind cover to hide at least a portion of the turret from enemy fire.\n\n=== Mobility ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}\n<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle.

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\n\nAs the {{PAGENAME}} is very comparable to the [[Leopard 1 (Family)|Leopard 1 Series]], especially the [[Leopard A1A1]], it is recommended to play them in the same fashion as such. In a Hit & Run tactic.\n\nThe additional benefits of the {{PAGENAME}} over the [[Leopard A1A1]] are:\n\n* A top mounted .50 which can be used to deal with soft targets swiftly or damage gun barrels or track opponent tanks.\n* Hydropneumatic suspension to:\n** Increase gun depression or elevation.\n** Improve traverse rate off- and on road.\n** Could vary the sloped angle of its armour towards the enemy.\n* Stronger turret armour\n* Night vision spotlight\n* Better ammunition available:\n** Stock HEAT shell for the 74F while the Leopard starts with an APDS shell.\n** APFSDS shell researchable at tier I while it is a tier IV modification for the A1A1.\n\nWith all the additional benefits out of the way, it shouldn't be negated it's still a gen 2 MBT with barely any armour to rely upon other than the strong turret which still will be defeated by most rounds that the {{PAGENAME}} will face. It is advised to make use of the terrain to your advantage in combination with the hydropneumatic suspension. The stabilizer also allows for the {{PAGENAME}} to shoot on the move and due lower top speed compared to the Leopard, should be even easier to shoot on the move.\n\nBut even though armour isn't the strong suit of the {{PAGENAME}}, it gets an amazing choice of rounds to make use of. Even the strongest tanks shouldn't disregard a stock {{PAGENAME}} as it gets HEATFS as stock shell and has access to the M735 APFSDS shell as soon as tier I (with a second more potent Type 93 APFSDS shell as tier IV modification), while such a shell usually is a tier IV modification for most [[L7A3 (105 mm)| 105 mm L7A3]] carrying tanks, this improves the {{PAGENAME}}'s combat performance by a lot.\n\n''In a nutshell:'' Use the mobility with the cannon's perfection to flank and spank enemies (But if you have to resolve to a frontal attack, the APFSDS still allows for such a playstyle). Wait and hunt for the perfect positions and kill the enemy tanks one by one, while always maintaining a good situational awareness. Patience is the key to success.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness.

Working alongside Mitsubishi once more, they looked for a new tank design incorporating many new features introduced in tank technology. This resulted in the tank having the hydropneumatic suspension system from the U.S.-German project MBT-70, a hull shape similar to Germany's [[Leopard I]], and the powerful [[L7A1 (105 mm)|105 mm L7 gun]] for its main armament. Other planned features for the tank was a rotatable commander's cupola and an autoloader system for the main gun.\n\nThe first prototype arrived for testing in 1968 as the [[STB-1]]. Modifications to the design started in 1969, which saw the autoloader removed for being too complex and expensive, as well as the removal of a proposed remote-controlled anti-aircraft machine gun for the same reason. The turret design was also elongated for various design purposes. The modified prototype was labelled ''STB-3'' and was delivered in 1971. The final prototype, ''STB-6'', was then delivered in 1973. The tank was then accepted for service in 1974 as the '''Type 74''' tank. Production would start in September 1975 all the way to 1989, producing 893 tanks.\n\n===Service===\nDue to the defensive nature of the JSDF and the absence of any hostility rising out of the Cold War, the Type 74 spent its service life in the JGSDF with no battle service. During its service life however, it was upgraded with new hardware such as infra-red imagers for night fighting and a laser rangefinder for the commander. Despite all that, the Type 74 was generally outdated in terms of specifications even before entering service, as second-generation main battle tanks like the [[Chieftain Mk 3|Chieftain]] and [[T-72A|T-72]] outclass it and development for third-generation main battle tanks like the Leopard 2 and [[M1 Abrams]] were already underway.\n\nThe tank was to be replaced by the newer [[Type 90]] main battle tank, but the collapse of the Soviet Union and the official end of the Cold War caused the replacement program to be halted. Today, the Type 74 still sees limited service in Japan and it was reported that 700 units were still in use in 2006.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=jp_type_74 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n{{Skin-gallery\n |market|Type 74 of the 1st Sensha Daitai|Type 74 of the 1st Sensha Daitai.png|Camo \"1st Sensha Daitai\"\n |market|ugcitem_1000551|Type 74 of the 1st Sensha-gun 304th Chutai.png|Camo \"1st Sensha-gun, 304th Chutai\"\n}}\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|tmKtl0WGdxA|'''Type 74 tanks in a public demonstration - 2014''' - ''JP&#8209;SWAT''|C1HCuRbl9lw|'''Real Sound Recording: Type 74 Edition''' - ''DMM GAMES Official Channel''|TZEt-V6V2WQ|'''JGSDF Type 74: 360° Video''' - ''DMM GAMES Official Channel''}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n;Related Development\n* [[STB-1]] - <small>(Prototype Stage)</small>\n* [[Type 74 (Family)]]\n* [[Type 87]] - <small>(SPAAG built on a modified Type 74 Hull)</small>\n\n;Other vehicles of similar configuration and role\n* [[Leopard 1 (Family)]]\n** [[Leopard A1A1]]\n* [[AMX-30 (Family)]]\n** [[AMX-30 Super]]\n* [[OF-40 (Family)]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wt:en/news/4396-development-type-74-the-height-of-technology-en/|[Devblog] Type 74: The Height of Technology]]\n* [[wt:en/news/4380-development-hydropneumatic-suspension-in-war-thunder-en/|[Devblog] Hydropneumatic suspension in War Thunder]]\n\n{{Japan medium tanks}}"}}
