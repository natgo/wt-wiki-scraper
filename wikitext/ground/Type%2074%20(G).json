In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium gift rank {{Specs|rank}} Japanese medium tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.87 \"Locked On\"]]. Compared to its tech tree counterparts, the [[Type 74 (E)]] and [[Type 74 (F)|(F)]], it has the IR floodlight replaced by a thermal imaging system and a minuscule upgrade to its protection in the addition of sideskirts.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->\nThe armour on the Type 74 is nothing special and shouldn't be relied upon to survive a shot from the enemy. It is therefore better to not get hit by an enemy tank shell to begin with. Its only merit is being able to resist autocannon rounds from light tanks or IFVs, which can buy precious seconds for the {{PAGENAME}} to retaliate before the enemy gets a good shot.\n\nWith four crew members, the survivability of the {{PAGENAME}} after penetration is on-par with other tank designs from USA and Germany. The prominence of APFSDS shells at this rank combined with the thin armour of the {{PAGENAME}} can mean instances where an APFSDS penetrates the armour and goes right through with minimal shrapnel damage, and so relatively little interior damage outside of the APFSDS' direct flight path.\n\nThe special thing about this tank is its pneumatic suspension. It give you the possibility to be fully hull-down on mountains. That capacity can make the {{PAGENAME}} less visible and therefore less exposed to enemy fire.\n\n'''Armour type:'''\n\n* Rolled homogeneous armour (Hull, Side skirts)\n* Cast homogeneous armour (Turret, Gun mantlet, Cupola)\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->\n\nThe {{PAGENAME}}'s mobility is pretty decent and comparable to the [[OF-40 Mk.2A]] or [[Leopard A1A1]], but slightly slower. The {{PAGENAME}} however has a reverse speed of only -14 km/h against -25 km/h for the previously mentioned tanks.\n\nWhile the {{PAGENAME}} can outspeed Soviet, British, and most American medium tanks, don't expect to be faster than a [[BMP-2|BMP]], [[TAM]], [[M3 Bradley|Bradley]], or the faster premiums like [[OF-40 (MTCA)]] or [[AMX-30 Super]].\n\n{{tankMobility|abMinHp= 1116|rbMinHp= 637}}\n\n=== Modifications and economy ===\n{{Specs-Economy}}\n\n== Armaments ==\n{{Specs-Tank-Armaments}}\n=== Main armament ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Weapon|1}}\n<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun.

Give advice on how to use them and how to fill the ammunition storage.'' -->\n{{main|L7A3 (105 mm)}}\n\nThe gun is identical to the tech tree versions of the Type 74, a 105 mm L7A3 cannon. It possesses one of the more potent kinetic shells of the rank with its Type 93 APFSDS. Although the reload time is not as fast as other 105 mm armed tanks that can be encountered, like the [[Leopard A1A1]], [[OF-40]], and the [[AMX-30 Super]], the Type 93 APFSDS has even greater penetration power than the L44 cannon on the [[Leopard A1A1 (L/44)]].\n\nThe gun comes with a stabilizer so firing on the move with the {{PAGENAME}} is possible. The gun depression of 6 degrees is, on paper, relatively poor that doesn't allow for effective fighting from ridgelines, requiring a position that exposes the tank more to get a shot at your target. However, the pneumatic suspension can compensate for the lack of gun depression, and so it must be utilised to get the most out of the {{PAGENAME}}.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"100%\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" | [[L7A3 (105 mm)|105 mm L7A3]] || colspan=\"5\" | Turret rotation speed (°/s) || colspan=\"4\" | Reloading rate (seconds)\n|-\n!

Like the APFSDS shot, increased armour thickness results in reduced amount of spalling (shrapnel) after penetration. You are able to take out enemies on any distance, since the HEAT round does not lose penetration with distance travelled - very handy on large maps. Unlike APFSDS it has one downside: given that it is a chemical round, its fuse is highly sensitive in regards to its practical application in battle. As a result, virtually anything, such as trees or even a fence, will set it off prematurely, so you cannot fire through obstructions with this kind of round. Knowledge of potential opponents vehicle layouts will be very handy to use.\n* '''M735''': APFSDS; a kinetic rod with high penetration power but without explosive filler. It is capable of easily penetrating the majority of the foes it meets, but these rounds do require finesse as to their placing. Because the projectile lacks an explosive filler, the best bet is to try and either knock out the majority of the enemy tank's crew or to destroy the enemy by ammo or fuel detonation through hitting their respective storage capacities. This, of course, requires knowledge about the vehicles the {{PAGENAME}} may face - so be sure to use the game's x-ray view in the hangar and analyse potential foes for their weak spots! Also, keep in mind that with increased armour thickness the amount of shrapnel shrinks.\n* '''M416''': Smoke; useful to blind enemy vehicles that are too remote for you to disable so that you can progress towards objectives.\n* '''Type 93''': APFSDS; a kinetic rod with increased penetration power compared to the M735.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"100%\"\n! colspan=\"8\" | Penetration statistics\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" data-sort-type=\"text\" | Ammunition\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Type of<br>warhead\n! colspan=\"6\" | Penetration @ 0° Angle of Attack (mm)\n|-\n! 10 m !! 100 m !! 500 m !! 1,000 m !! 1,500 m !! 2,000 m\n|-\n| Type 91 || HEATFS || 400 || 400 || 400 || 400 || 400 || 400\n|-\n| M735 || APFSDS || 353 || 350 || 342 || 333 || 322 || 312\n|-\n| Type 93 || APFSDS || 405 || 403 || 396 || 388 || 378 || 370\n|-\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"100%\"\n! colspan=\"10\" | Shell details\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" data-sort-type=\"text\" | Ammunition\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Type of<br>warhead\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Velocity<br>(m/s)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Projectile<br>Mass (kg)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Fuse delay<br>(m)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Fuse sensitivity<br>(mm)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Explosive Mass<br>(TNT equivalent) (g)\n! colspan=\"3\" | Ricochet\n|-\n! 0% !! 50% !! 100%\n|-\n| Type 91 || HEATFS || 1,150 || 10.5 || 0.05 || 0.1 || 1,270 || 65° || 72° || 77°\n|-\n| M735 || APFSDS || 1,501 || 3.7 || N/A || N/A || N/A || 76° || 77° || 80°\n|-\n| Type 93 || APFSDS || 1,501 || 3.4 || N/A || N/A || N/A || 78° || 80° || 81°\n|-\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n! colspan=\"7\" | Smoke shell characteristics\n|-\n!

Refrain from creating a \"guide\" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\n\nThe Type 74 (G) is a classic MBT with good mobility and firepower. It's fast enough to be somewhat competitive with its peers (although low-speed acceleration and manoeuvrability are lacking, which makes urban fighting sometimes tedious), and can sometimes reach favourable early-game positions before the enemy. The Type 74 (G) is slower than the [[AMX-30 Super]], [[OF-40 (MTCA)]], and most IFVs, so watch out for those tanks in situations where mobility is required.  The Type 74 (G)'s reverse speed is mediocre, so peeking an enemy in order to take a shot can be dangerous; the enemy may have time to fire back before the Type 74 (G) can retreat into cover. All in all, this tank has good mobility, but it can't be depended on in a pinch, and it certainly doesn't give the Type 74 (G) a significant advantage over the enemy.\n\nThe armour on the Type 74 is nothing special and shouldn't be relied on to survive a shot from the enemy. Any APFSDS shell can penetrate the Type 74 (G)'s armour from practically any angle. It is therefore better to not get hit by an enemy tank shell to begin with. The armour's only merit is being able to resist machine gun and autocannon rounds from light tanks or IFVs such as the [[BMP-2]], which can buy precious seconds for the {{PAGENAME}} to retaliate before the enemy gets a good shot. With four crew members, the survivability of the {{PAGENAME}} after penetration is on-par with other tank designs from the USA and Germany. The prominence of APFSDS shells in this rank combined with the thin armour of the {{PAGENAME}} can mean instances where an APFSDS shell penetrates the armour and goes right through with minimal shrapnel damage, and so relatively little interior damage outside of the APFSDS' direct flight path.\n\nWith the Type 74 (G), it is recommended to take no more than 15 shells into battle, since these first 15 shells are stored in a relatively safe compartment in the turret. With these shells, the tank is able to penetrate most enemy tanks except at very long ranges. The Type 93 APFSDS shell is one of the best at this tier, and a quick reload time lets the Type 74 (G) be a deadly weapon on the battlefield. The Type 74 (G) has a worse rotation than most Western MBTs, although it is better that that of Soviet tanks. This difference can mean the difference between life and death in situations where quick aiming is important. This tank is also able to use a pneumatic suspension system to lower or raise its hull on its suspension. This is useful when firing from behind cover. The Type 74 (G) can go fully hull-down when behind a ridgeline, and ridgeline sniping is therefore one of this vehicle's strengths. While it's not recommended, it is possible to use the tank's 12.7 mm machine gun to fight light tanks like the [[AUBL/74 HVG]].\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness.
