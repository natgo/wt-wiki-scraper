In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Japanese tank destroyer {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.91 \"Night Vision\"]].\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->\n\nThe armour of Type 75 SPH resists 7.62 mm machine gun fire from any side and can sustain 12.7 mm rounds when angled from any side, however, the hull is made out of aluminium, so it's actual effective armour is around 15 mm. Because of that, the tank can be knocked out by large-calibre HE shells.\n\nFor that reason, it is not recommended to drive to hostile tanks closer than 300 m and slightly angle to avoid being shot with MG from the side and about 700 m to avoid unnecessary damage. Slightly angle the tank towards passageways to have a chance of making a reply shot. Do not angle too much, to avoid exposing your sides or triggering fuses on rank V APHE, which mostly has 19 mm trigger with exception of German and some US tanks which have 14 mm sensitive fuse.\n\nFront of the hull can take the most of the MG punishment due to various modules taking damage for the crew, with high chance of just being set on fire instead, however, if enemy aims for the turret they will eventually hit weaker flat parts and hit the non-critical crew with a chance of taking out the gunner. Keep your opponents on your left to prevent that from happening.\n\nThe right front side of the hull houses the driver. They are sealed away from turret compartment by the engine and fuel tanks. The turret houses the rest of the crew. Quite often, explosive damage to one section does nothing to the other, however, pure AP shells can potentially penetrate modules and destroy crew in both of the sections, or hit the charges on the floor of the turret.\n\n'''Armour type:'''\n\n* Aluminium alloy 7039 (hull, turret)\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

There is nothing they can do about it because you can fire like this even over mountains. This trick is unlikely to work in RB due to inferior rangefinding capability.]]\n155 mm cannon of this tank destroyer is capable of launching High Explosive shells at the enemy. It does not carry any other offensive ammunition, however, it carries three different types of HE. What separates its gun from most of other \"Demolition tanks\" is that it has the autoloader, which allows it to reload at least three times faster than the ones that do not, which is insane. As a side effect, the reload speed is not affected by the crew skills and status and will always remain the same.\n\nThe gun is surprisingly accurate even when stock at up to ~700 m ranges and can still hit even past 1 kilometre away. While it does not hit the exact mark, it is usually good enough. However, when braking, the gun can bounce, so some care should be taken when fighting at close range.\n\nWhen compared to the clearly similar artillery tanks, the {{PAGENAME}}'s weapon claims the middle ground with a focus on combat support and versatility.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"100%\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" | [[NSJ L/30 (155 mm)|155 mm NSJ L/30]] || colspan=\"5\" | Turret rotation speed (°/s) || colspan=\"4\" | Reloading rate (seconds)\n|-\n!

It can essentially destroy almost any tank that doesn't have ERA shielding in one hit. As with other HE tanks, like the [[Ho-Ro]], it can't penetrate armour directly on many tanks, so one has to aim for cupolas, machine guns, chassis and other weak spots. For example the [[M103]] have great frontal armour, but it can be simply shot at the turret base, and the shockwave will breach hull roof armour and hit the ammo rack located just below the turret in the hull, resulting in instant destruction.\n\n'''M107 (PF)''': Also an HE shell like the M107, but with a 3 m proximity fuse, so it does not explode upon impact but earlier instead, when the radio fuse (inside the shell) detects an obstacle nearby. Notice that this is a proximity fuse, and not a radio fuse. This means that the fuse will not detect the aircraft unless in immediate proximity (3 m radius). \n\n'''Type 75''': This HE shell doesn't have a proximity fuse, but its muzzle velocity is faster, which make it more reliable at over 1 km range and allows for significantly easier and faster aim in RB. It was achieved by reducing its penetration power.\n\n'''M110''': It is also possible to fire a smoke shell to blind enemy snipers or to hide someone on your team.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"100%\"\n! colspan=\"8\" | Penetration statistics\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" data-sort-type=\"text\" | Ammunition\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Type of<br>warhead\n! colspan=\"6\" | Penetration @ 0° Angle of Attack (mm)\n|-\n! 10 m !! 100 m !! 500 m !! 1,000 m !! 1,500 m !! 2,000 m\n|-\n| M107 || HE || 61 || 61 || 61 || 61 || 61 || 61\n|-\n| M107 (PF) || HE-VT || 61 || 61 || 61 || 61 || 61 || 61\n|-\n| Type 75 || HE || 54 || 54 || 54 || 54 || 54 || 54\n|-\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"100%\"\n! colspan=\"10\" | Shell details\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" data-sort-type=\"text\" | Ammunition\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Type of<br>warhead\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Velocity<br>(m/s)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Projectile<br>Mass (kg)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Fuse delay<br>(m)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Fuse sensitivity<br>(mm)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Explosive Mass<br>(TNT equivalent) (g)\n! colspan=\"3\" | Ricochet\n|-\n! 0% !! 50% !! 100%\n|-\n| M107 || HE || 580 || 43.1 || 0 || 0.1 || 9,140 || 79° || 80° || 81°\n|-\n| Type 75 || HE || 720 || 43.6 || 0 || 0.1 || 6,800 || 79° || 80° || 81°\n|-\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"100%\"\n! colspan=\"12\" | Shell details\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" data-sort-type=\"text\" | Ammunition\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Type of<br>warhead\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Velocity<br>(m/s)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Projectile<br>Mass (kg)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Fuse delay<br>(m)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Fuse sensitivity<br>(mm)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Explosive Mass<br>(TNT equivalent) (g)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Arming distance<br>(m)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Trigger radius<br>(m)\n! colspan=\"3\" | Ricochet\n|-\n! 0% !! 50% !! 100%\n|-\n| M107 (PF) || HE-VT || 580 || 43.1 || 0 || 0 || 9,140 || 300 || 3 || 79° || 80° || 81°\n|-\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n! colspan=\"7\" | Smoke shell characteristics\n|-\n!

Type 75 SPH has optics similar to [[ST-A1]] and they are same as the German sniper scopes of the rank.\n\nWhile optics are very powerful on this tank, they may be inconvenient to use in RB until the type 75 shell is researched due to low velocity of the standard shell. In arcade mode, unless you are trying to launch the top shell at a distance over 1,000 m it rarely matters.\n\nEven in the worst cases, the excessive magnification power can still be exploited if the user manually zero-in gun scope to 300-X m distance, so they can directly aim at tanks even with maximum zoom. This helps to target out their weak spots and launch HE exactly where it hurts when the tank is spaded. This comes with a disadvantage of the scope being too high for close combat, so keep the \"reset\" button or third-person view aim ready.\n\nUse Rangefinder and zero-in the gun distance manually wherever necessary to make operating the tank easier. For example, to use proximity shell against a tank in cover, range-find the object which they hide behind, set scope distance to that exact number and intentionally overshoot it by a few meters.\n\n=== Machine guns ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Weapon|2}}\n<!-- ''Offensive and anti-aircraft machine guns not only allow you to fight some aircraft but also are effective against lightly armoured vehicles.

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\n\nThis vehicle is very powerful with its high explosive and fuze shells, however it comes at a cost. The Type 75 is the very definition of a glass cannon: this vehicle is incredible at close range engagements, but can not snipe long distances as it is an artillery howitzer. It is recommended that you watch your surroundings as this vehicle has so little armour that machines guns alone can penetrate your armour. Used right, this vehicle can dominate the battlefield as its proximity fuze shell can easily take out an enemy behind cover.\n\nIt is highly recommended to become familiar with large maps. Experiment on large maps using some landmarks to help with long distance aiming.\n\nThe Type 75 has an almost unique ability to annihilate tanks that are hiding behind cover completely, which is usually something only an ATGM carrier can do. Its HE shells allow to exploit weak spots and openings in the armour of battle tanks, which are normally not penetrable by contact explosives, although it's not 100% reliable and might take several shots. The HE-VT shell with a proximity fuse is perfect to engage targets while staying behind cover. Keep in mind that it must still fly at least 300 m away from your tank to activate, so it will not work at close range.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed-hover\" heights=\"250px\">\nFile:Type 75 SPH proximity fuse used on Ho-Ri.jpg|Proximity fuse of type 75 explodes mid-air before hitting Ho-Ri armour and penetrates ventilation to hit ammo rack. Ho-Ri explodes. Normally, the HE shell would hit the gun mantlet and set the engine on fire and nothing else, or just ricochet off the hull and away.\nFile:Type 75 SPH proximity fuse used on Type 60 ATM.jpg|Type 75 SPH uses proximity fuse on type 60 ATM that is completely hidden behind a hill. It exploded above the vertical ATGM tank, surprising and destroying it. Normally the shot would be impossible to land and type 60 ATM would just continue destroying any passing by tank - like nothing happened.\n</gallery>\n\nIt will also react to the ground surface, so try to overshoot your opponent so that the shell remains higher than 3 m from the ground before it reaches your target. In many cases, the proximity fuse shell will detonate before reaching the enemy, due to nearby obstacles accidentally triggering the fuse.\n\nNot every tank should be attacked with a proximity shell, as it's not always beneficial. For example, Soviet medium and heavy tanks do not have any glaring weak spots, which can be potentially hit by an airburst shockwave, so they should only be attacked by normal HE ammo. On contrary, their SPAA and light tanks are as vulnerable as they are dangerous, and so it is reasonable to try and spend some proximity shells to weed them out, instead of leaving your cover and risking being annihilated by suppressing fire.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness.

This resulted in the creation of the Type 75 and Type 74, respectively.\n\nThe Type 75's design was largely based on that of the existing Type 74 SPG and Type 73 APCs, sharing many components and even assembly lines, all in an effort to reduce costs and save resources. Development was split between two Japanese companies, with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries developing the chassis, while Japan Steel Works developed the turret and cannon.\n\nTwo prototypes were ready by the early 1970s, differing only in the type of loading mechanism used. Trials of these prototypes were conducted between 1973 - 1974. In October 1975, based on the test results, the prototype with a drum-fed autoloading mechanism was picked for series production.\n\nProduction of the Type 75 commenced in 1975 and went on until 1988, when all of the initially ordered 201 units were built. Although the Type 75 is still in active service with the JGSDF since their initial introduction in 1975, the number of units has gradually been decreasing in recent years as the Type 75 is slowly being phased out and replaced by the Type 99 155mm self-propelled howitzer.\n\nThe Type 75 has not yet participated in any combat operations during its service life and has been exclusively operated by the JGSDF thus far.\n\n''- From [[wt:en/news/6361-development-type-75-the-pulverizer-en/|Devblog]]''\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=jp_type_75 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|ux3UJ8qg8Go|'''The Shooting Range #268''' - ''Round Study'' section at 06:45 compares the rounds of the {{PAGENAME}}.|e2VsOCEhzy4|'''The Shooting Range #170''' - ''Metal Beasts'' section at 00:32 discusses the Type 75 SPH.}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n* [[2S3M]]\n* [[Bkan 1C]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wt:en/news/6361-development-type-75-the-pulverizer-en/|[Development] Type 75: The Pulverizer]]\n\n{{Japan tank destroyers}}"}}
