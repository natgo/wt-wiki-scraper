In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game.

The text within these arrows are not to be deleted -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' (Reconnaissance Combat Vehicle) is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Japanese light tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update \"Direct Hit\"]]. It is nicknamed \"{{Annotation|ブラックアイ|Burakkuai}}\" (Black-Eye) but is commonly simply referred to as RCV.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' The text within these arrows are not to be deleted -->\nMost of the survivability will result from the lack of armour, most of the vehicle is covered by 10 mm armour with some frontal plates at 20 mm protection. It will be easy to be penalized by machine gun fire if spotted but, if the bullets/shells hit in empty spots from the side, the shells will go clean through without any damage to crew or components.\n\n'''Armour type:'''\n\n* Rolled homogeneous armour (Hull, Turret)\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Once the APFSDS belt has been unlocked it can deal with most MBTs it faces by shooting out critical components one by one as this subcalibre 25 mm has barely any spalling effect.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"100%\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"6\" | [[Oerlikon KBA B02 (25 mm)|25 mm Oerlikon KBA B02]] || colspan=\"5\" | Turret rotation speed (°/s) || colspan=\"4\" | Reloading rate (seconds)\n|-\n!
