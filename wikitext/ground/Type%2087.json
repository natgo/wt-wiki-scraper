In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Japanese self-propelled anti-aircraft vehicle {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.67 \"Assault\"]]. It is incredibly similar to the German [[Gepard|Flakpanzer Gepard]], using the same [[Oerlikon KDA (35 mm)|35 mm Oerlikon KDA]] autocannons with a similar turret. The key difference is that the Type 87 uses a modified chassis of the [[Type 74]], compared to the Gepard being mounted on the [[Leopard I]] chassis.\n\nThe Type 87 performs fairly well at its rank, being able to effectively engage aircraft quite well thanks to its high rate of fire, quick turret traverse and radar systems. It is also capable of fighting lightly armoured tanks such as most infantry fighting vehicles (BMP, Warrior, M3 Bradley) and effectively killing them in seconds with its rapid-fire guns. The Type 87's default belts have less penetration than its predecessor, the [[M42 (Japan)|M42 Duster SDF]], although this is not much of a difference (72 mm on M42 compared to 68 mm on Type 87), however the Type 87 gains the ability to fight other MBTs when it unlocks the Armour Piercing belts, which have 116 mm of penetration at 100 m. While this is not advised, it is an incredibly handy ability to have in an emergency.\n\nThe Type 87 is also extremely proficient at shooting down helicopters - the [[AH-1G]] is a common nuisance that the Type 87 has no difficulty in destroying. However, for more modern helicopters, most notably the Kamov [[Ka-50]], the Type 87 is harmless.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection.

Assess its effectiveness in a battle based on the reloading speed, ballistics and the power of shells. Do not forget about the flexibility of the fire, that is how quickly the cannon can be aimed at the target, open fire on it and aim at another enemy. Add a link to the main article on the gun: <code><nowiki>{{main|Name of the weapon}}</nowiki></code>. Describe in general terms the ammunition available for the main gun. Give advice on how to use them and how to fill the ammunition storage.'' -->\n{{main|Oerlikon KDA (35 mm)}}\n\nMain weapons are the 35 mm Oerlikon KDA autocannons, which are essentially the same as [[Gepard]]'s. They are different from KDE gun variant of [[type 89]] if you used it - they use completely different ammunition and fire much faster.\n\nGuns will overheat if fired for longer than 15 seconds. They will cool off in about 30 seconds, but you can unjam them earlier by switching between ammunition belts.\n\nThe guns are placed close to the centre of a turret, typically, if you missed one shot, you probably missed both shots. For this reason SPAA relies more on precise lengthy bursts with enemy flight path prediction, rather than \"fire a 30 shot burst there and forget about it\" of [[Chieftain Marksman]]. You have more ammunition for the gun than British equivalent, to compensate for this.\n\n35 mm gun is slightly weaker than the Bofors of [[M42 (Japan)|M42]].  One thing to keep in mind is with this vehicle you are hunting jets and jets suffer much heavier stress from the speed they employ. This heavier stress equates to greater damage caused by even one or two hits of 35 mm HEI-T which will explode them or rip off their wings. For best results, you just need to hit them once or twice, which 35 mm guns are much better at doing.\n\nFor ammunition you can choose one main and one secondary belt. The secondary belt only has 40 shells, but it can be used to attack the enemy from capture points, as it rearms significantly faster. However, the secondary belt can be used in place of the main one for self-defence while the main belt rearms, so as to not leave the Type 87 defenceless.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"100%\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"6\" | [[Oerlikon KDA (35 mm)|35 mm Oerlikon KDA]] (x2) || colspan=\"5\" | Turret rotation speed (°/s) || colspan=\"4\" | Reloading rate (seconds)\n|-\n!

Both radars are mounted at the rear of the turret, with the search radar mounted on top of an arm and the tracking radar mounted at the base of the arm. The radar system is capable of tracking a target while scanning, but can only track targets within a 200° arc from the front of the turret. It is not possible to fold the radars at this time.\n\nSearch radar of this tank may often fail to catch passing by planes at closer ranges, which can be still locked on by tracking radar. In such case, you can try to go to sniper mode and aim crosshairs at enemy aircraft, then press \"lock on\" key to trigger manual tracking radar scan (will be visible by a quick sweep on radar display). If it failed, then the enemy plane has way too low relative speed to be consistently tracked.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n! colspan=\"5\" | [[MPDR 12]] - Target Detection Radar\n|-\n! {{Annotation|Maximum<br/>Detection<br/>Range|The maximum possible range at which a target can be detected}}\n! {{Annotation|Minimum<br/>Detection<br/>Range|The range, below which, a target cannot be detected}}\n! {{Annotation|Max Azimuth<br/>Scan Angle|How far to each side the radar can scan (widest search mode)}}\n! {{Annotation|Max Elevation<br/>Scan Angle|How far up and down the radar can scan (widest search mode)}}\n! {{Annotation|Minimum<br/>relative speed|The minimum speed a target must be moving, relative to the radar, in order to be detectable by the radar}}\n|-\n| 15,000 m || 500 m || 360° || ??? || 10 m/s (36 km/h)\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" | [[Albis]] - Target Tracking Radar\n|-\n! {{Annotation|Maximum<br/>Tracking<br/>Range|The maximum range at which a target can be tracked}}\n! {{Annotation|Minimum<br/>Tracking<br/>Range|The range below which targets cannot be tracked by the radar}}\n! {{Annotation|Azimuth Tracking<br/>Angle|How far to each side the radar can track a target}}\n! {{Annotation|Elevation Tracking<br/>Angle|How far up and down the radar can track a target}}\n! {{Annotation|Minimum<br/>target speed|The minimum speed a target must be moving, relative to the radar, in order to be tracked by the radar}}\n|-\n| 15,000 m || 75 m || ±100° || -20°/+85° || 15 m/s (54 km/h)\n|-\n|}\n\n== Usage in battles ==\n<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in the vehicle, the features of using vehicles in the team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a \"guide\" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\nAs an anti-aircraft vehicle, you should push with your team and defend cap points by protecting allies from aircraft with your powerful 35 mm guns. It should not be a problem to stay away from the main battle unless you are being pushed or your position is being overrun. In case if you see enemy light SPG or light tank, you can try to destroy them as well. With APDS belt you may dare to attack decently armoured medium tanks from the side, but you only have enough ammo for one or two encounters, so make it count.\n\nDespite having radar, staying too far away from allies in arcade mode may backfire, as shells still take some time to reach enemy aircraft and hostile bombers only have to be 1.8 km away from them to drop bombs in the most efficient way possible, and it doesn't take a long time for them to reach that distance. If enemy aircraft is constantly wiggling, radar supported aim will also go all over the place, so try to guess where they are going, or press them to force them to change direction to one away from your allies.\n\nIn case if you actually got attacked by ground forces, you should then aim for cannon barrels and tracks of enemy vehicles. Your hull armour may deflect inbound shots if angled correctly, but don't expect your turret to do the same, as its armour is very thin and generally will be penetrated by everything at your battle rating and rank. Keep in mind, that your tank is a hull breakable vehicle, so avoid being hit by HEAT-FS rounds or by large kinetic shells into the engine compartment area.\n\nUse [[Hydropneumatic suspension]] to get better search radar coverage and gun depression on your targets, or to keep yourself standing flat. Standing flat is important, as being angled too much may add horizontal targeting error.\n\nIn case if you are fighting multiple attackers or rocket helicopters, avoid being carpet-bombed, as the Type 87 is not built to survive such attacks. Be especially careful with Soviet helicopters, as they can carry both rockets and missiles. Remember - radar lock will help your gun to stay on target even when you are moving, and so, if you see a wall of rockets approaching you, sidestep it and don't just stand there and take it.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics.

The specification and concept for the new anti-aircraft vehicle was based on the German Gepard SPAAG that our players know so well. The vehicle used a modified Type 74 tank chassis and was equipped with the Oerlikon 35 mm twin cannon system as used in the Gepard. The vehicle was a success – more than 50 of these SPAAGs were put into production and several units remain in service today.\n\n- ''From [[wt:en/news/4512-development-type-87-the-japanese-gepard-en|Devblog]]''\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicleCountry=japan&vehicleType=tank&vehicleClass=spaa&vehicle=jp_type_87 '''Skins''' and '''camouflages''' for the Type 87 from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n;Vehicles equipped with the same chassis\nThe Type 87 is based on a modified [[Type 74 (Family)|Type 74]] hull\n* [[Type 74]]\n* [[Type 74G]]\n\n;Vehicles equipped with the same guns\n\n* [[Gepard]]\n* [[Chieftain Marksman]]\n\n;Other vehicles of similar configuration and role\n\n* [[M247]]\n* [[ZSU-23-4]]\n* [[AMX-30 DCA]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''encyclopedia page on the tank;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wt:en/news/4512-development-type-87-the-japanese-gepard-en/|[Devblog] Type 87: The Japanese Gepard]]\n\n{{Japan anti-aircraft vehicles}}"}}
