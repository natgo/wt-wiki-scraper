In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Japanese medium tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.95 \"Northern Wind\"]].\n\nThe Type 90 MBT was initially accepted into service in 1990 as a replacement for both the [[Type 61]] and [[Type 74]] models. Despite its appearance being similar to the [[Leopard 2A4]] and mounting a license produced Rheinmetall L44-based cannon, it is significantly different in a number of aspects. The {{PAGENAME}} MBT is modification of the [[Type 90|Type 90 MBT]] to allow for a Type 92 mineroller to be equipped on the front.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->\n\n[[File:Type 90 Density Visualisation.png|thumb|Type 90 [[Protection Density Visualisation]]]]\nThe Type 90 MBT was designed with inspiration from the Leopard 2A4, but sacrifices much of the 2A4's protection and survivability in order to attain a smaller profile and a lighter vehicle overall (vehicle weight is important in Japan in order to pass over their many bridges). As such, most 'improved' rounds available to other 10.0-10.3 MBTs (such as the [[Leopard 2A5]]'s DM33, or the [[Leclerc]]'s OFL 120 F1) will punch through even the Type 90's turret cheeks or upper front plate. It's important to keep in mind that even some autocannon ammunition will easily penetrate some of the weaker sections of the Type 90 from the front.\n\nDespite the mediocre protection, the Type 90 has one main survivability feature: its primary ammunition is stored in blowout-protected compartments, sparing the crew from side shots on the rear of the turret, providing no more than 19 rounds are carried. Unfortunately, however, due to the autoloaded cannon the Type 90 is crewed by only 3, increasing the chances of being disabled from an initial shot.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Armour !!

Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->\n\n{{tankMobility|abMinHp=2032|rbMinHp=1327}}\n\nThe {{PAGENAME}} is powered by a 10-cylinder two-stroke diesel engine producing a maximum of 1,500 horsepower at 2400 RPM. Combined with its relatively light weight of only 51.6 tonnes, this gives it an excellent power-to-weight ratio of 29.07. As such, the Type 90 is often one of the first vehicles to reach cap points in a match, and can comfortably flank or move into advantageous positions earlier than many of its contemporaries. This power is transferred to the drive sprockets via an automatic transmission with 7 forward and 2 backward gears, unfortunately limiting the otherwise extremely mobile vehicle to 72 km/h (RB/SB) forwards and -33 km/h (RB/SB) backwards - speeds which it will reach with ease on-road.\n\nThe {{PAGENAME}} also mounts hydropneumatic suspension, allowing it to actively change the vehicle's ride height and angle. This can be used to improve traction on angled surfaces.\n\n=== Modifications and economy ===\n{{Specs-Economy}}\n\n== Armaments ==\n{{Specs-Tank-Armaments}}\n=== Main armament ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Weapon|1}}\n<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun.

Give advice on how to use them and how to fill the ammunition storage.'' -->\n{{main|Type 90 L/44 (120 mm)}}\n\nThe Type 90 L/44 120 mm cannon is a license-produced clone of the Rheinmetall L/44 cannon found on the Leopard 2 series and the M1A1/M1A2. As such, it shares their excellent accuracy and firepower characteristics, with a key advantage: the Type 90 is autoloaded. This results in a flat 4 second reload, better than the peak manually loaded speeds available to the other L/44-mounting vehicles (6 seconds). Additionally, reloads are not hindered by fire or the loss of crew members. The Type 90 has two rounds available to it; the powerful JM33 APFSDS round (based off the NATO DM33 round) and the JM12A1 HEAT-FS round (based off DM12A1). These rounds are more than capable of penetrating any opponent the Type 90 may face, although when facing some later vehicles such as the M1A2 or Leopard 2A5, weak points must be targeted.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"100%\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" | [[Type 90 L/44 (120 mm)|120 mm Type 90 L/44]] || colspan=\"5\" | Turret rotation speed (°/s) || colspan=\"4\" | Reloading rate (seconds)\n|-\n!

It should ideally be used for early flanks where available (such as the eastern flank on [[Maginot Line (Ground Forces)|Maginot Line]]) or when unavailable, pushing quickly for early captures before moving to a nearby protected location to hold that point. It's important to be aware of which routes might be sniper-covered early, as many snipers (such as the [[Challenger 2]] or [[Ariete PSO]]) will easily penetrate the {{PAGENAME}}, even at range - avoid giving them the opportunity.\n\n'''Urban Combat'''\n\nThe {{PAGENAME}} can prove itself to be an excellent urban combat vehicle, primarily due to its mobility and reliably fast reload. As in rural combat, an early push for a cap can prove viable before moving into a protected position, although often by the time the capture is completed enemy targets will be nearby. Early flanking (such as around the sides of [[American Desert]]) is also viable.\n\n'''Notable Targets'''\n\n* [[Challenger 2]] - The Challenger 2 is often found as a sniper due to its pin-point accuracy, good reload and excellent turret armour. The Type 90 should never be used to face a sniping CR2 head-on, but instead should attempt to flank or force engagements at close range where weak spots are easily targeted.\n* [[M1A2 Abrams]] - The M1A2 Abrams has excellent frontal protection and can prove tricky to discern from earlier models in the heat of a battle. As a general rule it's preferable to aim for the gun mantlet or turret ring on any Abrams, despite the fact that JM33 will penetrate nearly anywhere on early models - better safe than sorry.\n* [[Leopard 2A5]] - The Leopard 2A5 is very well protected, although JM33 will punch through its hull without any significant trouble. Avoid fighting a hull-down 2A5 head-on, rather taking flanking routes when available. If no choice is presented, aim for the gun mantlet or the turret ring.\n* [[T-80U]] - The T-80U is extremely well protected from the front, and care should be taken when engaging - aim for the driver viewport or the lower front plate; or where these are not options try to disable its gun through the mantlet. If flanking, side shots will often despatch the T-80U quickly.\n* [[Leclerc]] - The Leclerc is extremely fast, with a power-to-weight ratio not far short of the Type 90's. When pushing early for caps or flanks, be aware that the Leclerc may be one of the first vehicles you'll counter.\n* [[Leopard 2K]] - The Leopard 2K has the best power-to-weight ratio of any MBT currently in War Thunder, and it will often be capable of getting to positions before the Type 90. Keep in mind that it can be penetrated anywhere, but aware the 'bouncy' armour; aim carefully.\n* [[AMX-40]] - The AMX-40 is extremely mobile and caution is advised when pushing early. Fortunately, the AMX-40 has negligible protection and JM33 will make quick work of it.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness.

A central aspect of the new machine would have to be the ability to take on and defeat the new Soviet T-72 main battle tank. With that in mind, Japanese engineers began working on a prototype design, which would see completion in 1980. Two prototypes of this initial design were built, tested and improved upon between 1980 - 1986.\n\nTesting resumed in 1986 with a second batch of four prototype vehicles, featuring a number of improvements over the initial two. The most significant change included the replacement of a Japanese-made 120mm smoothbore gun with the established Rheinmetall 120 L/44, most notably used by the M1A1 Abrams and Leopard 2 at the time. The decision to change the gun from a domestic one to a licence-built alternative most likely came as a measure to reduce production costs. However, unlike the MBTs of western armies, the designers of the Type 90 opted to equip the tank with an autoloading mechanism, making it the only production vehicle that did so in combination with the Rh 120 cannon. Further testing and army trials of these prototypes was conducted during the late 80s before the Japanese army formally introduced the tank into service in 1990 as the Type 90. Production of the Type 90 began in 1990 and continued until 2009, with 341 vehicles made.\n\n''- From [[wt:en/news/5499-development-type-90-the-lightweight-heavy-hitter-en|Devblog]]''\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=jp_type_90b Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|p6cWlyUnJQA|'''Top 7 off-road beasts'''  discusses the {{PAGENAME}} at 4:27  - ''War Thunder Official Channel''|31ZOmtzI_2g|'''The Shooting Range #107''' - ''Metal Beasts'' section at 00:35 discusses the {{PAGENAME}}.|K-9ObimGTJI|'''JGSDF Type 90: Actual Sound Recording''' - ''DMM GAMES Official Channel''|G_jOfO3g_iA|'''JGSDF Type 90: 360° Video''' - ''DMM GAMES Official Channel''|xarYzM07uSk|[JP] '''Former SDF member spectates Type 90 at firing range''' (Part 1)|AyvnH_sBgrg|[JP] '''Former SDF member rides Type 90 at firing range''' (Part 2)}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n;Related Development\n\n* [[Type 90]] - <small>(base model)</small>\n* [[Type 10]] - <small>(successor)</small>\n\n;Other vehicles of similar configuration and role\n\n* [[Leclerc (Family)]]\n* [[M1 Abrams (Family)]]\n* [[Leopard 2 (Family)]]\n* [[Ariete (Family)]]\n\n== External links ==\n''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.''\n\n{{Japan medium tanks}}"}}
