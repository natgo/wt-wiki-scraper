In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Swedish light tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.97 \"Viking Fury\"]]. It is a prototype vehicle from the late 1950s based on the Unimog 404 truck chassis. The key feature of this vehicle is the dual, high-penetration, fast-firing rocket launchers mounted on top of it, making it a force to be reckoned with for any tank it faces.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->\n\nThe U-SH-405 simply cannot afford to take any damage, it will die instantly from pretty much anything. However, the ability to fire its high-penetration rockets with no reload time at all makes it very good at taking out any target, and even several targets at once if the occasion arises.\n\nWith only 2 crew members and only 10 mm of armour at most, the U-SH 405 will die very easily, be it to aircraft, machine-guns, artillery, etc. As such, it is best to avoid frontal engagements unless necessary.\n\n'''Armour type:''' <!-- The types of armour present on the vehicle and their general locations -->\n<!-- Example: * Rolled homogeneous armour (Front, Side, Rear, Hull roof)\n* Cast homogeneous armour (Turret, Transmission area) -->\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

However, in Realistic, the top forward speed is 73 km/h (45.3 mph) for 90 horsepower, making it good on-road but just decent off-road and awful at climbing hills. The reverse speed is 9 km/h (5.5 mph), which works most of the time but can still be too slow in some situations (especially off-road).\n\n=== Modifications and economy ===\n{{Specs-Economy}}\n\n== Armaments ==\n{{Specs-Tank-Armaments}}\n=== Main armament ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Weapon|1}}\n{{Specs-Tank-Weapon|2}}\n<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun.

The rockets can be fired all at once in less than 10 seconds, making it able to kill several tanks of any type in just a few seconds, provided they are aimed properly.\n\nThe rockets are most efficient at close to medium range, over 600 m, they start to become quite inaccurate. On top of the only 18 rockets, it is also fairly long to replenish them; as such, one should use them with caution.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"100%\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" | [[Oerlikon Typ 3Z 8Dla]] launcher (x2) || colspan=\"5\" | Turret rotation speed (°/s) || colspan=\"4\" | Reloading rate (seconds)\n|-\n!

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\n\nThanks to the very high penetration of its HEAT rockets, the U-SH 405 can kill any tank it faces from pretty much any angle; this, combined with its near-instant reload and high on-road speed gives it great flexibility. However, the vehicle can be killed by anyone and anything, the main threats to the U-SH 405 are American tanks (and any other tank that has high-calibre machine-guns) and aircraft. Some tanks in particular, like the American T34, T30 and T32, should be avoided because of their multiple .50 cal MGs and somewhat high survivability against the rockets.\n\nThe low post-penetration damages require one to aim at a tank's critical spots (such as the ammo storage or the gunner) if they want to disable/kill the target with only 1 or 2 rockets. Fortunately, the near-instant reload allow for several follow-up shots if the first rocket did not do as well as hoped.\n\nThe good mobility and low-profile makes the U-SH 405 very good at flanking and relocating in general, and the high firepower makes it devastating on unaware targets.\n\nThe U-SH 405 works best at supporting allied vehicles as they can draw attention away from itself, but the limited amount of ammunition forces it to stay relatively near strategic points to be able to replenish its limited ammunition count.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as \"bad\", \"good\" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as \"inadequate\" and \"effective\".'' -->\n\n'''Pros:'''\n\n* Low-profile, can be easily concealed\n* Almost completely silent, making it easy to sneak up on enemies undetected\n* Good speed on roads\n* Fast-firing rockets (basically no reload at all between each rocket) with very high penetration\n* The rockets are fast are very easy to aim\n\n'''Cons:'''\n\n* Extremely weak armour and only 2 crew members (will nearly always instantly die from .50 cal MGs)\n* Small, light frame and small crew lets it easily be destroyed by hard collisions at high speeds or crushed by heavier tanks\n* Awful power-to-weight ratio in realistic (15.7 hp/t) making it quite slow off-road (30-35 km/h) and barely able to climb hills\n* The HEAT rockets explode have limited post-penetration damage\n* The rockets are ineffective at long range as they heavily deviate over time (even a mere 800 m may prove difficult)\n* Only 18 rockets, and you may need several rockets to kill just one tank due to their late detonation\n* You can only replenish rockets once you've used all 9 of them, and replenishing takes a fairly long time\n\n== History ==\n<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction.

Development was initially headed by the Germans, but in 1958, Landsverk took over the lead role in its development.\n\nAs part of the ongoing development, Landsverk came up with a dedicated tank hunter variant of the vehicle in 1960, fitted with a pair of Oerlikon 81mm rocket launchers, originally developed for aircraft and helicopter use. A single prototype of the machine was built and trialed, but no production orders were issued.\n\nHowever, the APC version of the U-SH 405 saw more success, being ordered by the Belgian armed forces in limited numbers. Despite placing an order for around two dozen vehicles, due to various geopolitical reasons, Belgium only received fewer than half of the machines initially ordered. The remainder of the machines built, but not shipped to Belgium were later on sold to the Irish military in the early 1970's, which used the vehicle until 1978 before retiring it.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=sw_landsverk_ush_405 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Images\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"150\">\nFile:U-SH 405 WTWallpaper 01.jpg|\nFile:U-SH 405 WTWallpaper 02.jpg|\nFile:U-SH 405 WTWallpaper 03.jpg|\nFile:U-SH 405 WTWallpaper 04.jpg|\nFile:U-SH 405 WTWallpaper 05.jpg|\nFile:U-SH 405 WTWallpaper 06.jpg|\n</gallery>\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|OR18NRGT7uw|'''The Shooting Range #254''' - ''Metal Beasts'' section at 00:26 discusses the {{PAGENAME}}.|vHooKt3mEcU|'''U-SH 405 - Rocket Turret Death Machine''' - ''PhlyDaily''}}\n\n== See also ==\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wt:en/news/6631-development-swedish-ground-vehicles-u-sh-405-en|[Devblog] Swedish Ground Vehicles: U-SH 405]]\n\n{{TankManufacturer AB Landsverk}}\n{{Sweden light tanks}}\n[[Category:Wheeled ground vehicles]]"}}
