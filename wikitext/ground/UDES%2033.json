{"title":"UDES 33","pageid":9732,"wikitext":{"*":"{{Specs-Card\n|code=sw_udes_33\n|images={{Specs-Card-Image|GarageImage_{{PAGENAME}}.jpg}}\n}}\n\n== Description ==\n<!-- ''In the description, the first part should be about the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle, as well as its key features. In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' (shortened to '''UDES 33''', literally ''Ground Group Direct Fire Combat Vehicle 33'') is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Swedish tank destroyer {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.97 \"Viking Fury\"]].\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->\nThe thickest plate on the UDES 33 is 18.5 mm, and all armour plates are rolled homogeneous steel. Survivability is very poor. A single shot to the hull can instantly knock out at least two of the four crew members (however, hitting all four is far more common). Furthermore, the gunner is completely exposed from the waist up.\n\n=== Mobility ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}\n<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->\n\n{{tankMobility|abMinHp=213|rbMinHp=133}}\n\n=== Modifications and economy ===\n{{Specs-Economy}}\n\n== Armaments ==\n{{Specs-Tank-Armaments}}\n=== Main armament ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Weapon|1}}\n<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun. Assess its effectiveness in a battle based on the reloading speed, ballistics and the power of shells. Do not forget about the flexibility of the fire, that is how quickly the cannon can be aimed at the target, open fire on it and aim at another enemy. Add a link to the main article on the gun: <code><nowiki>{{main|Name of the weapon}}</nowiki></code>. Describe in general terms the ammunition available for the main gun. Give advice on how to use them and how to fill the ammunition storage.'' -->\n{{main|Rbs 55}}\n\nThe Rbs 55 is a potent ATGM at the battle rating, however the reload leaves something to be desired. The time it takes to reload the ATGM will allow many of your foes to replace their crew members before you are ready to fire again, so this must be kept in mind. Often times it is best to retreat back into cover if the missile only knocks out an opponent's gunner, rather than dealing sufficient damage to their gun breech or barrel. Additionally, the UDES 33 can only carry a maximum of 10 missiles, so they must be used sparingly. Taking a full ammo load is recommended. The speed at which the missile launcher can be aimed at a target is decent, however do not expect to be able to quickly return fire at an opponent should you manage to survive a shot from them. The launcher is restricted in horizontal movement to approximately the 3 and 9 o'clock positions.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"100%\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" | [[Rbs 55]] missile || colspan=\"5\" | Turret rotation speed (°/s) || colspan=\"4\" | Reloading rate (seconds)\n|-\n!

Refrain from creating a \"guide\" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\nThe UDES 33 performs best when using natural terrain cover, as it cannot take very much punishment. It is advisable to sit behind the primary lines of the allied team, and pick enemies off that expose themselves in the distance. Be wary of IFVs and SPAAs (or any vehicle with a high rate of fire), as well as the machine guns mounted on any vehicle, as the gunner is exposed entirely and the hull armor is very weak. Notable opponents include the [[M3 Bradley]], [[M163]], [[Gepard]], [[BMP-2]], [[ZSU-57-2]], [[ZSU-23-4]], [[Warrior]], [[Falcon]], [[WZ305]], [[SIDAM 25]], and [[AMX-30 DCA]]. The UDES 33 can perform at battle ratings 8.0-8.7, but when at 6.7-7.3, the angle of armour on many German tanks should be considered before engaging.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as \"bad\", \"good\" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as \"inadequate\" and \"effective\".'' -->\n\n'''Pros:'''\n\n* Rather agile for its tonnage, and when upgraded is surprisingly quick and nimble, easily allowing for moving from cover to cover\n* Low profile, not a very large target and very unnoticeable when standing still\n* ATGM penetration proves adequate\n* Great gun depression, allowing the vehicle to fire from behind cover by simply exposing the ATGM launcher\n\n'''Cons:'''\n\n* Gunner is largely exposed; his whole torso is above the turret ring, leaving him vulnerable to MG fire, shrapnel, and aircraft guns\n* Somewhat long reload time\n\n== History ==\n''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block \"/History\" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template.
