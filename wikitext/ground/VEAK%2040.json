In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' (English: \"Wagon Fire-control AutoCannon 40\"), or '''{{PAGENAME}}''' for short, is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Swedish self-propelled anti-aircraft vehicle {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.97 \"Viking Fury\"]]. The name {{PAGENAME}} follows Bofors naming scheme, not the Swedish army's naming scheme. Its full historical Bofors-name was Bofors VEAK 40 X 60, VEAK indicating type (tracked vehicle with FC-radar and autocannons), 40 indicating calibre (40 mm) and 60 indicating year of design (1960).\n\n[[File:VEAK 40 vinter.png|350px|thumb|left|A {{PAGENAME}} keeping the skies clear over Northern Europe.]]\nThe {{PAGENAME}} was developed by the Swedish arms manufacturer Bofors by request of the Swedish army as a 1960s next generation Swedish SPAA following the 1940s limited production Lvkv fm/43 SPAA and failed 1950s [[Lvkv 42]] prototype SPAA. A single prototype based on the Strv 103 chassis was built and delivered for testing in 1964. The project was delayed at this point but testing commenced and the vehicle proved to be ahead of its time regarding armament and fire control system. This however made the vehicle too costly and in the end the project had to be scrapped due to resources going to the Swedish air force rather than the Swedish air defense.\n\nThe {{PAGENAME}} is armed with two 40 mm Bofors L/70 autocannons (Swedish designation: [[lvakan m/48 (40 mm)|40 mm lvakan m/48]]) which each have a fire rate of 300 rounds per minute and are capable of firing proximity-fused high explosive shells which will airburst and damage aircraft when reaching their vicinity. It has mediocre mobility and subpar protection but does feature excellent vertical and horizontal traverse speed for the guns. It also comes equipped with a tracking and search radar that allows the player to find and track airborne targets within a 12 km radius.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n{| class=\"wikitable floatright\"\n|-\n| [[File:Veak40external.png|centre|x250px]] || [[File:Veak40internal.png|centre|x250px]]\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | External armour on the {{PAGENAME}} || style=\"text-align: center;\" | Internal armour on the {{PAGENAME}} \n|-\n|}\nThe armour of the {{PAGENAME}} is roughly 15 mm thick all around with very limited sloping angles to back it up. Thus even heavy machine guns can knock it out from all directions. The turret is very big and boxy and also houses all of the vehicles ammunition and crew. Thus a shot to the turret usually results in an ammo rack detonation. The hull however is fairly empty of components and only houses the transmission and engine which are located in their own compartment, resulting in tons of empty space in the hull under the turret. Thus a shot to the hull usually leaves the vehicle combat capable.\n\n'''Armour type:'''\n\n* Rolled homogeneous armour\n* Cast homogeneous armour (Cupolas)\n* Structural steel (Radar mast, Radar dish, Mud skirts, Suspension)\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The vehicle is based on the chassis of the [[Strv 103A]] and features the same transmission and engine (although currently  lacking turbine engine sound) while being 7.9 tons lighter. The engine gives out 540 hp in realistic when fully upgraded, giving this 29 ton vehicle a power to ton ratio of 18.62. This gives the tank great acceleration on shorter distances and allows it to effectively move around the battlefield like the average speedy light tank.\n\n'''Mobility times on flat paved terrain (realistic)'''\n\n*Time to 60 km/h (max effective) forward: > 25 s\n*Time to 20 km/h forward: > 2 s\n*Time to 18 km/h (max effective) reverse: > 2 s\n*Time to rotate 360°: < 8 s\n\n'''Mobility times on flat grass terrin (realistic)'''\n\n*Time to 40 km/h (max effective) forward: < 11 s\n*Time to 20 km/h forward: > 2 s\n*Time to 18 km/h (max effective) reverse: > 2 s\n*Time to rotate 360°: < 8 s\n\n=== Modifications and economy ===\n{{Specs-Economy}}\n\n;Modification route\n\n*Stage 1 (Primary Route): Like with every tank the first modifications to research should be {{Annotation|Parts|Parts allows for repair of vehicle modules in combat.}} and {{Annotation|FPE|FPE allows for extinguishing of internal fires in combat.}}. \n\n:After those it is best to unlock the ammunition (slsgr m/484 {{Annotation|HE-VT*|High-explosive variable time fuse (self-destroying)}} and slpprj m/42B {{Annotation|AP|Armour-piercing}}). Depending on the desired playstyle you can either go for the HE-VT or AP first. The slsgr m/484 is excellent for taking out aircraft, while the slpprj m/42B is great at taking out tanks in the side.\n\n*Stage 1 (Alternate Route): If you prefer to sit in the spawn or behind cover and solely shooting at aircraft then a viable alternate route would be to unlock slsgr m/484 {{Annotation|HE-VT*|High-explosive variable time fuse (self-destroying)}} as your first unlock (before Parts and FPE).\n\n*Stage 2: After unlocking Parts, FPE and ammunition you can either go for mobility upgrades or fire-control upgrades depending on the desired playstyle.\n\n:If you desire to kill tanks then go for mobility upgrades such as Filters, Engine and Transmission. This will allow you to easily flank and outmanoeuvre enemy tanks with some planning. \n\n:If you desire to kill aircraft then go for fire-control upgrades such as Horizontal Drive, Adjustment of Fire and Elevation Mechanism. This will give you one of the best targeting speeds in the game.\n\n*Stage 3: After unlocking enough performance upgrades for comfort then it is viable to unlock Artillery Support. \n\n:Follow this by unlocking the suspension upgrades: Suspension > Brake System > Tracks. \n\n:The last upgrade to unlock is Crew Replacement. Due to the limited survivability of the {{PAGENAME}} and its ability to stay fully combat capable without one crew member there is rarely a need to restore a dead crew member.\n\n== Armaments ==\n{{Specs-Tank-Armaments}}\n=== Main armament ===\n[[File:VEAK 40 firing.png|thumb|right|x300px|Two {{PAGENAME}} combating air targets.]]\n{{Specs-Tank-Weapon|1}}\n<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun.

This is extremely rare for SPAAs and makes it one of two SPAAs that has a secondary machine gun (the other one being the [[Lvkv 9040C]]).

It has a radar and effective anti air guns that will easily take out any aircraft even at longer ranges with ease. The guns also has fairly high penetration on its armour-piercing ammo and will easily take out lightly armoured vehicles in the front and the majority of vehicles in the side. Its protection is more or less non-existent and the {{PAGENAME}} can even be dealt with using regular low-calibre machine guns. \n\nWhen playing the {{PAGENAME}} it is best to stay in spawn and shoot at incoming aircraft, or using the great mobility to follow team-mates into battle and support them with suppressive fire and anti-aircraft support. If there are no aircraft to shoot at then it is viable to cruise around the map at high speeds and hunt lightly armoured targets and capture points. \n\nDue to the large profile of the turret there are rarely options for hiding behind cover and thus it is best to play aggressively and using your high speed, stabilized guns and high fire rate to defeat enemy tanks. The radar mast retracts behind the turret like on a lot of other radar SPAAs when turned off, allowing you to become slightly less visible. Turning it off may be a good choice, if you are not looking to be spotted as easily if you believe enemies may be nearby. \n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness.
