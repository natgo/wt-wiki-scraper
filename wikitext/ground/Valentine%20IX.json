In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} British medium tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced along with the initial British tree line in [[Update 1.55 \"Royal Armour\"]].\n\nAt its BR, the Valentine's protection starts to let it down a bit, uptiers can bring guns powerful enough to cut through the Valentine's armour anywhere. Still, the protection is fairly good, especially on the turret cheeks but the hull is somewhat weaker. Mobility is poor. However the Mark. IX sports the formidable 6-pounder gun, which can reliably get through the armour of many vehicles. The Valentine's small profile also allows it to be \"sneaky\".\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members.

The sides are 50 mm thick, so angling can be effectively done. The turret is a lot better, featuring both 60 mm turret cheeks sloped forwards, there is still a breach weak spot, where the armour is flat, the sides of the turret are still pretty strong at 60 mm but flat, however turret angling should not be done as it will normalize the cheeks.\n\nAs for post-pen survivability it is fairly poor, as there is only three crewmates, a driver in the hull, a gunner and a loader in the turret, so a hull pen will practically always result in a one shot, a turret armour breach might knock out only one of the turret crew, but can one shot as well.\n\nThe Valentine gets 2 smoke grenades, but for some reason they launch together and don't create a particularly impressive smoke screen.\n\n'''Note:'''\n\n* Suspension wheels, bogies, and tracks are 20 mm thick.\n* Belly armour is 20 mm thick.\n\n=== Mobility ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}\n<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->\nThe mobility of the Valentine IX shouldn't be surprising: it is bad. As a British infantry tank, the mobility of the Valentine IX is severely limited: you can reach at most 24 km/h on perfectly flat and solid ground, and on slopes you will travel much slower (10-20 km/h). As a result the Valentine IX can only keep up with similarly slow and heavy tanks, like the [[B1 bis|B1]] or [[Matilda (Family)|Matilda]].\n\nYour reverse speed is straight up awful: -2 km/h, not so different than not being able to reverse at all. Thus you must make sure that where you are heading towards is very safe as you will not be able to reverse back to safety quickly. Sometimes turning around at 180° will be faster, if you accelerate a little bit before that you will turn more easily. But turning on the move will bleed a lot of your speed away. The power-to-weight ratio is very low, meaning the Valentine IX will become painfully slow and sluggish on bad roads or slopes. In maps like Frozen Pass or White Rock Fortress, the Valentine IX must choose roads to drive on, or else it will be as slow as ~15 km/h.\n\n{{tankMobility|abMinHp=256|rbMinHp=146}}\n\n=== Modifications and economy ===\n{{Specs-Economy}}\nSuggested research order:\n# Parts & FPE: being able to repair and extinguish a fire is always important on the battlefield.\n# Mobility modifications: they can be researched first to increase the poor mobility of the stock Valentine IX as much as possible.\n# Others, such as firepower modifications.\n# The shells can be the last ones, since the stock Shot Mk.5 AP has reasonable penetration and spalling, and is enough to deal with most opponents.\n\n== Armaments ==\n{{Specs-Tank-Armaments}}\n=== Main armament ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Weapon|1}}\n<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun.

Similar to some previous British tanks, this cannon has a quick reload for its calibre of ~4.5 seconds which allows the player to fire more shots if the first round didn't disable or destroy the target. This gun provides rather flat projectile trajectories which is good for beginners to aim at longer ranges (>600 m).\n\nThe gun depression is great, at -12° it will be able to suit most mountainous maps. The turret rotation speed of ~13° is very average: it is fast enough to swivel towards the target if the target is not far away from where the gun is pointing at, but too slow to quickly respond to anything that's far from the gun's direction.\n\nLike the previous Valentine XI, the IX model does not have access to a gun stabiliser so tactics like CQC may not be as smooth as before.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"100%\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" | [[6pdr OQF Mk.III (57 mm)|57 mm 6pdr OQF Mk.III]] || colspan=\"5\" | Turret rotation speed (°/s) || colspan=\"4\" | Reloading rate (seconds)\n|-\n!

[[Sd.Kfz.234/2]], [[M4A1]], [[SU-85]]) the Valentine IX will face. The shrapnel is reasonable, being able to damage anything in its path, or anything around the path if the point of penetration is far enough for the shrapnel to spread out. However this shell will struggle against heavy tanks like [[KV-1 (L-11)]] especially when they are angling and/or at a distance.\n\n* Shot Mk.5 HV and Shot Mk.8: these shells provide a few milimetres more penetrations over the default AP, and a faster velocity. The slightly better penetration gives limited improvement against mildly armoured targets like [[M4A4 (China)|M4A4]]. Therefore these shells are placeholders just leading up to the best round.\n\n* Shot Mk.9: this APCBC should be the primary ammo choice for Valentine IX tankers thanks to its great penetration of ~120 mm and slightly improved ricochet angles. Now the Valentine IX is able to penetrate not only normally armoured targets, but also heavy tanks with relative ease. This shell can go through the weak spots of almost all tanks the Valentine IX will ever face.\n\n* Shell Mk.10: this HE has too little explosive filler to actually damage anything except non-armoured targets like [[GAZ-MM (72-K)|GAZ]] trucks. Even the thin armour of a [[Sd.Kfz.251 (Family)|Sd.Kfz 251]] has some chance to protect its crew against this HE shell. Thus it is not very recommended to bring this ammo into battles.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"100%\"\n! colspan=\"8\" | Penetration statistics\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" data-sort-type=\"text\" | Ammunition\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Type of<br>warhead\n! colspan=\"6\" | Penetration @ 0° Angle of Attack (mm)\n|-\n! 10 m !! 100 m !! 500 m !! 1,000 m !! 1,500 m !! 2,000 m\n|-\n| Shot Mk.5 || AP || 101 || 97 || 82 || 66 || 53 || 43\n|-\n| Shot Mk.5 HV || AP || 108 || 104 || 87 || 70 || 57 || 46\n|-\n| Shot Mk.8 || APC || 110 || 106 || 89 || 72 || 59 || 48\n|-\n| Shot Mk.9 || APCBC || 122 || 118 || 101 || 84 || 70 || 58\n|-\n| Shell Mk.10 || HE || 9 || 9 || 9 || 9 || 9 || 9\n|-\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"100%\"\n! colspan=\"10\" | Shell details\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" data-sort-type=\"text\" | Ammunition\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Type of<br>warhead\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Velocity<br>(m/s)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Projectile<br>Mass (kg)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Fuse delay<br>(m)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Fuse sensitivity<br>(mm)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Explosive Mass<br>(TNT equivalent) (g)\n! colspan=\"3\" | Ricochet\n|-\n! 0% !! 50% !! 100%\n|-\n| Shot Mk.5 || AP || 815 || 2.8 || N/A || N/A || N/A || 47° || 60° || 65°\n|-\n| Shot Mk.5 HV || AP || 853 || 2.8 || N/A || N/A || N/A || 47° || 60° || 65°\n|-\n| Shot Mk.8 || APC || 853 || 2.87 || N/A || N/A || N/A || 48° || 63° || 71°\n|-\n| Shot Mk.9 || APCBC || 801 || 3.23 || N/A || N/A || N/A || 48° || 63° || 71°\n|-\n| Shell Mk.10 || HE || 655 || 2.72 || 0 || 0.1 || 590 || 79° || 80° || 81°\n|-\n|}\n\n==== [[Ammo racks]] ====\n[[File:Ammoracks_{{PAGENAME}}.png|right|thumb|x250px|[[Ammo racks]] of the {{PAGENAME}}]]\n<!-- '''Last updated:''' -->\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\n'''Overview:'''\n\nThe Valentine IX is an interesting vehicle. The armour can be useful against most enemy cannons if you angle properly, but the mobility is sub par. The 6 pounder gun provides excellent penetration with a fast velocity, not to mention the reload rate and semi stabilization. The best way to play the Valentine IX is to play around cover and play carefully. The benefit of being slow is it gives Valentine commanders time to think before they act. The Valentine will be the last to the fight in most situations, so make sure to pay attention to your allies and enemy positions as they reveal themselves. With careful planning, the Valentine can preform very well. Because it is so slow, it is important to play with your team. Use the map to point out enemy positions and pay attention when your allies do the same. Also be careful not to push too far into enemy territory, your low speed will not let you get out quickly. You cannot rely on smoke cover for retreats either as you only get 2 smoke grenades that are launched together, which is far fewer than most British vehicles. Another weakness to consider with the Valentine IX specifically is the lack of a machine gun. While the MGs on most tanks are not often used, lacking one is still a disadvantage.\n\n'''Notable Enemies:'''\n\n* [[T-34 (Family)|T-34]]: the T-34 is commonly used and can be difficult to kill when using the Valentine IX because the 6-pounder gun struggles against angled armour. Against the T-34, shoot for the turret or machine gun port. Avoid the hull (if angling) and the heavily curved areas of its spherical gun mantlet which can very likely result in bounces.\n* [[Pz.IV F2]]/[[Pz.IV G|G]]: the Panzer IV F2 and Panzer IV G will make short work of the Valentine, regardless of armour angling, since they have a powerful long 75 mm cannon with ~130 mm of penetration. This level of firepower is more than enough to penetrate the armour of the Valentine IX even when angling. Against a Panzer IV F2 or G, just make sure you shoot first. If it's facing you, target the right side of the turret to disable its gunner. If it's facing elsewhere, you can break its engine or driver to pin it down, then finish it with quick follow-up shots.\n\n'''Differences AB vs RB:'''\n\nWhile the slow speed can be an advantage in RB, allowing Valentine commanders to play more cautiously, it AB it is a simple disadvantage. However the other qualities of the Valentine allow it to be a somewhat competitive front line medium tank in AB, using its angled armour and firepower to bounce a few shots and easily dispatch most enemy vehicles.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as \"bad\", \"good\" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as \"inadequate\" and \"effective\".'' -->\n\n'''Pros:'''\n\n* 57 mm gun has decent penetration (~110 mm)\n* Upper glacis and turret are angled, can bounce a few shots\n* Low profile allows it to hide behind some obstacles\n* Decent stock shell\n* Fast reload speed\n* Great -12° gun depression, is helpful in hilly terrains\n\n'''Cons:'''\n\n* No machine gun, awkward to deal with truck-based vehicles like [[GAZ-MM (72-K)]]\n* Hull armour is unchanged from Valentine I, much less effective against better tanks like [[M4A1]]\n* Substandard mobility, with low top speed, slow hull traverse, and awful reverse\n* No explosive filler in shells\n* Only 3 crew members (crew can be knocked out very easily)\n* Thin top armour makes it vulnerable to air attacks\n* Unlike many other British tanks, very few smoke grenades and all are released at once.\n\n== History ==\n<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction.

This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->\n===Development===\nThe experiences taken from the development of the A9, A10 cruiser tanks and the A11 infantry tank prompted Vickers-Armstrongs to begin development of a new tank. As a private venture, the design did not receive any designations from the British General Staff during its creation. The designing of the tank focused on the tank having the weight of a cruiser, but with the armour comparable to the infantry tanks. The basis was to have the vehicle with 60 mm of frontal armour and a 2-pounder gun in a two-man turret. To make it as light as possible, it was small and featured a cramped interior. The design used features taken from the A9 and A10 tanks so the design was easier to produce and cheaper to make. Vickers unveiled the design to War Office at February 10, 1938. While they initially viewed it unfavourably for its tiny two-man turret, they took it in April 1939 due to the growing tense situation in Europe with Nazi Germany, with the first order coming in May 1940 after the losses suffered by the British Expeditionary Forces in the Battle of France. The name '''Valentine''' was given to the tank sometime between its introduction to War Office and its adoption. The origin of the name is disputed, some say it was due to its introduction on February 14 in 1938 or 1940, other say it was the middle name of Sir John V. Carden, who helped design the Valentine's predecessors. Other sources say it is a name from the Vickers' company full name (Vickers-Armstrong Ltd Elswick & [Newcastle-upon] Tyne), and David Fletcher from Bovington Tank Museum say that \"Valentine\" was a code name used by the company for its development.\n\nThe Valentine was put into service as quickly as possible under the designation ''Tank, Infantry, Mk.III''. Vickers, Metropolitan-Cammell Carriage & Wagon, and Birmingham Railway Carriage & Wagon Company were all involved in the construction of this vehicle. During World War II, Canada was also contracted to build the Valentine to build up their own tank forces. The United Kingdom produced a total of 6,855 Valentines during the war between the three company while Canada built 1,420 Valentine tanks in their factories, for a total of 8,275 tanks produced, making the Valentine the most produced British tank in the entire war.\n\n===Variants===\nThe Valentine is one of the most modified British tank in World War II, up to eleven variants were made during its entire production life.\n\n#''[[Valentine I|Mark I]]'': The first one, it was built with a rivet construction, a 135 hp petrol engine, and a 2-pounder, but was not sent to combat due to mechanical problems.\n#''Mark II'': Uses a 131 hp diesel engine and has an auxiliary fuel tank added to the left hull.\n#''Mark III'': Has a slightly thinner side armour (60 mm to 50 mm) and a modified turret design, giving room for a loader in the tank, freeing the commander to do his job.\n#''Mark IV'' A modified Mk.II using an American 138 hp GMC diesel engine and an American-produced transmission, making the tank more reliable.\n#''Mark V'': The same as Mk.IV, except using the Mk.III as the basis.\n#''Mark VI'': A Canadian built Valentine, using Canadian and American parts and a GMC diesel engine, plus later switching the BESA machine gun into a Browning machine gun.\n#''Mark VII'': A Canadian Mk.VI with a new radio set and a modified interior. Another Mk.VII named the ''Mark VIIA'' has jettisonable fuel tanks and new tracks, oil cooler, and headlights.\n# ''Mark VIII'': Uses a British AEC diesel engine and a modified turret to use the 6-pounder. The modification eliminated the coaxial machine gun from the design.\n#''Mark IX'': A Mk.V modified to take the 6-pounder as well, but with an armour reduction. Later version also had a stronger 165 hp GMC diesel engine installed.\n#''Mark X'': Features another modified turret design using the 6-pounder, but made it able to use a coaxial machine gun again and still uses the 165 hp diesel engine. Uses a welded construction\n#''[[Valentine XI|Mark XI]]'': The Mk.X using the QF 75 mm gun instead of a 6-pounder, with the 210 hp diesel engine. However, these tanks only served as a command tank in the battlefield. Uses a welded construction\n\n===Combat usage===\nThe Valentine mostly saw service in the North African Campaign, where the crew reported on it very favourable as a reliable and well-protected tank. The first unit who saw action with the Valentine was the 8th Royal Tank Regiment in Operation Crusader, where it was in the process of replacing the [[Matilda III]]. The reliability is expressed when some Valentines were reported to have travelled a distance of 4,800 kilometers by the time the British reached Tunisia. The Valentine tanks soon saw wide-spread use by mid-1941 when they were issued out widely to armoured regiments due to the lack of cruiser tanks available to fill in the ranks.\n\nHowever, the biggest weakness of the Valentine tank is the lack of high-explosive rounds for the 2-pounder, a weakness suffered by every other tank using the 2-pounder. This and the 2-pounder's growing deficiency against tank armour was remedied by the usage of the 6-pounder on the Valentine after the Mark VIII version, and then the QF 75 mm gun. However, these larger guns were harder to mount on the small Valentine turret and made for a cramped interior, even removing the established loader's position made in an enlarge turret for the 2-pounder. By the time these larger guns were introduced for the tank, better tanks were being introduced, such as the [[Churchill III|Churchill heavy tanks]] from Britain and the [[M4|M4 Shermans]] from the Americans. Despite the better tanks, the Valentine's low height is able to exploit small cover on the battlefield and take up a good hull-down position behind hills.\n\nSome Valentines were sent to the Soviet Union as part of the Lend-Lease program, most of the Valentines came from Canada's production lines. The Valentines saw use from the time of Battle of Moscow in 1941 all the way until the end of the war, though the Valentines saw use more as a second-line tank due to its relative weakness. It was criticized for its slow speed and weak gun, but was liked for its small size, reliability, and armour protection and thus the Soviet Supreme Command continue asking for it and its production to continue until the end of the war.\n\nBy 1944, the Valentine is mostly taken out from the front-line services and replaced by the newer tanks. A few were retained for special purposes and command vehicles for [[Archer]] units, which is a tank destroyer based off the Valentine chassis. The tank continue to see use in the Pacific in limited numbers until May 1945 in the 3rd New Zealand Division, some had their armaments changed to the larger 3-inch howitzer to use it stronger high-explosive ammunition against the Japanese. New Zealand kept the normal and modified Valentines all the way until 1955. The last known combat usage of the Valentine was on Cyprus in early 1960s when a turret-less Valentine was used by the Greek militia, added with a make-shift armour and a machine gunner position with a Bren gun.\n\n===Survivors===\nAbout forty Valentines and vehicles based off the Valentine chassis exist in various conditions in the world. Valentines in running condition exist in the Bovington Tank Museum and in private hands in New Zealand and United Kingdom. The Valentines survivors can be seen in UK, Canada, Belgium, France, Russia, Australia, and New Zealand.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=uk_valentine_mk_9 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|qfY_erhfnog|'''{{PAGENAME}} Tank Review''' - ''NUSensei''|xIrVVhdC9ac|'''Tank Chats #11 Valentine''' - ''The Tank Museum''}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.''\n\n{{Manufacturer Vickers-Armstrongs}}\n{{Britain medium tanks}}"}}
