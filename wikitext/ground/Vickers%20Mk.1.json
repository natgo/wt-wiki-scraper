It was introduced in [[Update 1.69 \"Regia Aeronautica\"]].\n\nThe Vickers Mk.1 is like a sniper, designed to engage with minimal threat to the tank and its crew while still being a major thorn in the enemy's side. Stick to the knowledge of the maps you'll be playing on to enhance your defensive playstyle, grabbing husks of old tanks or tank ditches to your advantage then bursting out of cover to ambush enemies. \n\nThat being said, the Vickers has pitiful armour that rarely stands up to any punishment other than SPAA, and even then this is true for the front armour. The ~100 mm frontal armour on the turret is good for stray or hurried shots, although the lack of slopes inhibits your chances of bouncing shots, let the environment do this for you.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection.

It is not fired alongside the other machine guns but through the \"Fire from secondary guns\" option (Controls > Ground Vehicles > Weaponry).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"50%\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" | [[L21A1 (12.7 mm)|12.7 mm L21A1]]\n|-\n!

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\nAlthough it can be done with its excellent reload speed of 5-7 seconds (crew skill depending), mixing ranks with the enemy is ill advised: instead take upon a sniping role. Your gun has only two types of ammo, both stock so research is not required for enhanced destruction. That being said, the APDS is a potent weapon that has 302 mm of pen at 100 m, falling to 252 mm at 2,500 m: all ranges can be targeted, with enemies moving towards more manoeuvrability over armour in the high ranks. However, the rounds lack spalling potential, so the damage inflicted on a tank interior must be in the APDS direct path past the penetration. If you aim for the turret weak spots, the barrel or breech will be your most common hits, incurring 20-30 precious seconds of repair time. If for any reason you're forced to engage while exposed, attempt to disable the enemy's gun or gunner first, before utilizing the excellent reload time to finish the target off.\n\nThe HESH shell is a very different story. While this odd round has its uses, it's somewhat limited in effectiveness against many targets. HESH, which stands for High Explosive Squash Head, relies on this so called 'squash head' spreading as much as possible, creating a spalling effect within the targeted vehicle. This means that it's not particularly effective against thick armour; and it should rather be used against lightly-armoured targets or targets which rely on highly angled armour for survivability. Generally, Vickers tankers will learn to prefer their APDS round for most engagements, only resorting to HESH against select targets.\n\nSome enemies that can be rough to deal with:\n\n* The Lorraine 40t will bounce more shots than you care to admit, or your hits will do minor damage. Just out the nature of the reserved play style this tank likes, any fast tanks will be a problem due to their ability to close the gap as you attempt to reach your favourite position. Engine and transmission upgrades will lessen this, in time.\n* All Soviet tanks are difficult to deal with, yet learning their weak spots will lead you to victory.\n* German tanks are a problem due to their accuracy and fast reload times, however the cheeks of their turrets, especially the Tiger II, are prime targets for eagle-eyed gunners.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness.

In 1961, India purchased the license for development, and Vickers-Armstrong helped to set up the factory. Over the course of its life, many variants were developed, including the Mk.2 and Mk.3. Later, Vickers Valiant(Mk.4) in 1977 and finally Mk.7 MBT.
