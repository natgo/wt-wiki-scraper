In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' (or just the '''{{specs|pseudonym}}''') is a rank {{Specs|rank}} British light tank {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.81 \"The Valkyries\"]].\n\nWarrior is basically a big box with a round turret, which has a little gun in middle, \"ears\" (ATGM cameras), and the ATGM launcher itself on the right side. Front of the hull is sloped to decrease small firearms damage. IFV hull is huge compared to even medium tanks of some factions (about double the size of [[T-62]]) and looks even bigger when carrying additional armour.\n\nIf the vehicle has add-on armour, it's easily identified for its riveted plates on sides of the vehicle. Usually, after being shot with a high velocity round, they break off. Plates do not protect the rear of the vehicle.\n\nThe Warrior is mostly played as an aggressive ATGM tank or ambush scout tank, though it can fulfil any role that doesn't involve it being constantly shot at.\n\nIt's best described as a hybrid between a slowed down SPAA and assault ATGM launcher, while armour is either nonexistent or installed via a modification to partially protect from hazards that normally annihilate light tanks. The weapon combo is potent enough to destroy even modern MBT's, and with add-on armour, the Warrior can bully even heavy tanks in close range, though the turret is still very vulnerable.\n\nThe Warrior can be played defensively (mostly around hills and mountains), or aggressively (on flat terrains and in towns), given that there is enough cover for the Warrior. In realistic battles, Warrior can also hide relatively well and use either of its weapons to punish unsuspecting people, or just scout them.\n\nThis vehicle is very easy to play while still in stock mode, as it has most essentials available at stock or unlocked early on, however, every upgrade only makes it even stronger.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection.

While at the first glance the hull may seem uniform, and technically thick enough to survive hits of kinetic shells up to 120 mm and chemical shells of up to 105 mm, it has a lot of weak points, which trigger overpressure damage. For that reason, if artillery hit its hull or turret directly, the {{PAGENAME}} will not survive and direct hit of explosive shells to the ventilation, middle of the tank on any side, ATGM optics or turret in general is likely to instantly destroy the tank.\n\nWhen considering smaller weapons, the {{PAGENAME}} is well protected against heavy machine guns, however, its turret, engine ventilation, hull's back and even sides have weak spots, which can be penetrated by 12.7 mm and 14.5 mm heavy machine guns. At some angles, the frontal ventilation port can be penetrated even by German 7.92 mm, however, it's near impossible to meet those at rank VI.\n\nThe hull frontal armour is sloped and can sustain light automatic cannon fire at best, allowing it to fight [[BMP-2]] or SPAA armed with 23 mm guns head-on in some scenarios, as long as they do not know where to fire. It is preferable to fight them from distance or while employing high ground to increase their attack angle as close to 60 degrees as possible, rendering their main weapons useless. The engine to the right of the driver can add a sort of spaced armour effect by absorbing penetrating shells. This works well in addition to the add on armour, as it means that half the front is protected by the engine and the other half by composite armour.\n\n'''Add-on Armour:'''\n\nThe add-on panels defend the sides of the hull, with a piece of composite on the frontal plate covering the driver. These panels are geared towards protection against Chemical munitions and add surprisingly little armour against kinetic rounds.\n\nThe side armour plates conceal weak spots on the {{PAGENAME}} hull and are effective against chemical rounds. In general, they prevent overpressure damage from being hit by HESH and HEAT (including ATGM), efficiency against HE varies depending on the hit spot. Angling can be an effective tactic with these panels installed, and it will also help the tank to survive some 30 mm kinetic rounds, as long as the screen is not destroyed (which usually doesn't take long). After being hit once by a big shell, these panels generally break off the tank and no longer protect it.\n\nThe composite in front of the driver is much stronger and is capable of stopping weak HEAT rounds with about 400 mm of penetration, and will also add enough kinetic protection to stop most direct 20 mm autocannon round hits. It will not save the tank from direct 120 mm HE hit, as the explosion will reach tank's turret or ventilation and likely annihilate vehicle via pressure damage.\n\n[[File:WarriorArmour ProtectionAnalysis HESH.jpg|x170px|thumb|right|Protection analysis view: frontal panel gives a 45% chance for the Warrior to not be destroyed from frontal HESH shot by just being there. Side armour does the same thing for the entirety of the sides but is significantly weaker.]]\n\nThese images show a Warrior surviving an ATGM fired from an IT-1 due to the additional armour:\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"100px\">\nWarriorArmour ProtectionAnalysis MagicPixel.jpg\nWarriorArmour IT-1Missile (1 of 3).jpg\nWarriorArmour IT-1Missile (2 of 3).jpg\nWarriorArmour IT-1Missile (3 of 3).jpg\n</gallery>\n\n=== Mobility ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}\n<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->\n\n{{tankMobility|abMinHp=852|rbMinHp=486|AoAweight=1}}\n\nMobility is adequate on vehicle's BR, it can move forward and backwards equally fast, but don't expect it to be climbing mountains like with the powerful [[Vickers MBT]] in Arcade Battles. It will just slide down if the surface is too steep.\n\nIn Arcade Battles, it's generally driving at 46-54 km/h offroad in either direction without engine upgrades, regardless of additional armour. With mobility upgrades it may drive up to 60 km/h, but not very often. Speed of 81-83 km/h can be reached if the {{PAGENAME}} drove off the hill and keep driving forward, or on completely flat terrains, like roads in the American desert, though sometimes it just doesn't work again at the same spot.\n\nDue to its sheer size, it almost never gives in to ramming attempts, though it cannot move enemy heavy tanks either and shouldn't fight them on a narrow street.\n\nAccidentally hitting something on max speed, especially explosive decorations, launches the Warrior up to 5 meters in the air, which is very entertaining, but almost never fazes the enemy.\n\n* Adding armour does not decrease {{PAGENAME}}'s hp/ton significantly, and it only reduces maximum climb angle by 2 degrees, so it should be used when unlocked without worries of mobility penalty.\n* Despite having enough horsepower, this vehicle can not climb mountains.\n\n=== Modifications and economy ===\n{{Specs-Economy}}\n\n== Armaments ==\n{{Specs-Tank-Armaments}}\n=== Main armament ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Weapon|3}}\n<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun.

The 30 mm APDS belt is capable of penetrating the front armour of most light vehicles, and the sides of almost any tank that the warrior will face. The sub-par fire rate and low post penetration effects mean that gunners will need to pick out individual crewmembers or modules in each well-placed shot. While not technically stabilized, warrior gunners can manage to fire with some accuracy on the move if they are skilled. The shell velocity in the RARDEN APDS belt allows the warrior to lay down effective fire on light enemy targets up to about 2 km, although it will be difficult to hit moving targets past about 1.5 km.\n\nThere is virtually no reason to use the stock belts on the warrior. The stock belt uses half HE and half AP rounds, but only the HE rounds have tracers. The lack of tracers causes awkward gunnery, and the penetration on the AP shell is not satisfactory. Meanwhile, the APDS belt has tracers with every round and is very effective against enemy vehicles.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"100%\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"6\" | [[L21A1 (30 mm)|30 mm L21A1]] || colspan=\"5\" | Turret rotation speed (°/s) || colspan=\"4\" | Reloading rate (seconds)\n|-\n!

It is 103 mm in diameter.\n\nMILAN launcher can be upgraded to the MILAN 2, which has 730 mm of RHA penetration. The MILAN 2 is 115 mm in diameter. The flight performance is essentially the same, but it's starting speed is higher.\n\nThe missile is guided via gunner's seat crosshair, if gunner cannot see missile directly, the tank will lose control over it, so any indirect attacks should be aimed quickly after sending missile as high as possible.\n\nThe MILAN can be used at close ranges, but cannot be fired point-blank (10 m or so), and if not careful it can overshoot (look at launcher itself in Third-person view to avoid this). The missile only has 2 km of range so it is not particularly useful against enemies at very long range, or more often against helicopters who are hovering far away from the battlefield.\n\nFor targets far away, it is recommended to use the laser rangefinder before launching the missile, in order not to waste a missile on a target beyond the 2 km range.\n\nIf commander optics (the ones on top of the turret) get destroyed, the Warrior cannot launch ATGM anymore. They can only be repaired via \"manual repair\".\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | 103 mm [[MILAN]] ATGM\n|-\n! Capacity\n! Vertical<br>guidance\n!

Refrain from creating a \"guide\" - do not impose a single point of view but instead give the reader food for thought. Describe the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\n\nGenerally, Warrior needs to quickly get into the medium range of the expected enemy, then figure out its strategy for the current battle. While moving towards an objective, Warrior should keep a low profile and scout every enemy it can notice.\n\nAfter looking around, Warrior either takes some hills or well-protected hull-down position near to capture point to utilize ATGMs and scouting ability for medium-range attacks and team support, or takes an aggressive approach and goes for stealthy flanks and close-range combat. It's not rare to see Warrior try and destroy heavy tanks, which just don't expect the light tank to go at them.\n\nIf forced, Warrior can always use a smokescreen to disrupt enemy plans of taking it down, either baiting them to waste time looking for it, or using smokescreen, MILAN-2, scouting and add-on armour together to attack the enemy from the fog with little fear of being punished for it. For some reason enemy does not often reply to ATGM shots but instantly fires back at cannon fire, so use cannon sparingly during this.\n\n[[File:Warrior shadow strike.jpg|thumb|Example of using smokes and armour '''offensively''' in arcade battle. Not only enemy is blinded and can't hold the line, allowing the team to rush in, but even if they fire towards the Warrior's general direction, they will likely load HESH or HEAT and fire at the hull, hitting the add-on armour and doing no or less than fatal damage. MILAN-2, on the other hand, is almost unblockable and can obliterate many tanks in one hit, and the player can clearly see the position of enemy tanks due to '''scouting'''. A skilled Warrior can take out up to two tanks per one smoke deploy like that. Works on any range from 30 m to 800 m.]]\nIn any mode, but especially in AB, mark the enemy with the \"scout\" ability, so they can be found whenever smoke is deployed. This must be done for two main reasons:\n\n# Since the MILAN ATGM can instantly destroy or cripple anything, even seeing just the name of enemy and type of tank through smoke is good enough for the Warrior to have a chance for a hit. In realistic battles, it's less reliable, but the Warrior can still see where the enemy is. For light tanks, the 30 mm autocannon can work just fine (just don't do that against BMP; unless it already spotted and scouted the Warrior, it's not worth it).\n# In Arcade Battles, If the \"intelligence\" reward is obtained for marking enemy that was or is invisible to teammates and then got destroyed, the player will get artillery support point and airstrike point. If the '''squadmates''' destroys the marked target, the player will get airstrike point regardless as a squad assist.\n\nDue to this, in 9.0 arcade battle, the Warrior can call in ATGM helicopters on '''very first minute''' of a fight, simply by marking 2 enemy vehicles and destroying someone with an almost undodgeable and unblockable missile, while the enemy cannot even request gunships to protect themselves from it. ATGM helicopter than can destroy 6 to 10 enemy tanks, '''significantly''' weakening the enemy team. As the game goes on, Warrior can join multiple air battles in a row as second attack helicopter or bomber, because it's a scout vehicle.\n\nSince MILAN has relatively good controls and there is 8 missiles total, the Warrior can try and fire it above hills and guide it down on people, much like Swingfire and Striker. It's harder to aim at the enemy without a straight visual firing line, but if it hits anywhere important, they could be knocked out anyway. Since the Warrior is considered a scout vehicle, mark them and ping them on the map, even if a shot lands a hit.\n\nIn Arcade Battles (AB), it's best to fire the missile at tank's gunner, so in case if it didn't destroy the tank on its own, the Warrior can just circle around the enemy and use the main gun to destroy the engine, then proceed to incapacitate the crew. In Realistic battles (RB) even taking out cannon barrel or breech might be enough, as repairs in that mode take much more time, and field repair doesn't even guarantee, that gun won't just jam itself again or fire in a completely different direction.\n\nAs with all light tanks play style, be very wary of people that have any kind of explosive ammo, as the Warrior has relatively low amount of armour on it and can be easily destroyed by overpressure damage. With Add-on armour, the Warrior can fight and take some hits, but the vehicle's turret, front and back are still a giant weak spot.\n\nUsually, MBT's will carry AP ammo as their first shot, which may just over-penetrate and maybe do almost nothing. So if there is an absolute must directly attack someone, attack them, SPGs or other non-Soviet light tanks.\n\nThere is also a trick related to the Warrior - if baiting an enemy that is looking towards the Warrior, pull the Warrior's rear end out of cover first. Since the rear has very little critical components outside of the MILAN missile stowage, usually being shot there doesn't do anything too drastic for the overall tank health. After being fired at, drive out of cover and fire back at them. This trick probably won't work twice, indicating you should make the most out of the opportunity you have at hand. Nobody likes to be shot with ATGMs and the second shot coming will most certainly be HE of some kind. This tactic may backfire if your IFV gets shot with APHE, or APFSDS will enter the vehicle at a bad angle, but those types of ammunition have the potential of instantly destroying Warrior regardless of the entry point.\n\nFinally, the Warrior can also repair any allies, so if in cover and not busy - do help them.\n\n====Specific enemies worth noting====\n<!--Some concerning vehicles to worry about if playing this tank and how to fight them in an encounter. (i.e. Tiger II - shoot the turret cheeks)-->\nAny Soviet light tanks: Destroy it with ATGM, use scout ability to see when they are trying to leave their cover, use gun adjustment to never miss, generally never play around with them. BMP-1 might accidentally hit tank's weak spot and destroy it's entire crew, BMP-2 will just turn on full auto mode on main gun and unload half of its magazine into its target, even if it misses its ATGM, just to get rid of a threat and even add-on armour won't save the Warrior at that point. Oddly enough, the infamous Object 906 is probably the least dangerous of them, but it will still destroy the Warrior with proper shot placements. If the Warrior is spaded in modifications, just call artillery strike on them.\n\nIS-7: Do not '''ever''' engage this thing frontally without MILAN 2 and add-on armour. It is also extremely risky to attack it on a narrow street. Fire at the right (their left) side, to disable its turret. The main goal in engaging this tank is to disable its engine with the 30 mm gun and then blow it up by destroying its ammo in back of a turret or just blowing it up by firing ATGM in the middle of it or into ammo rack, if there is a spare ATGM (the IS-7, as a threat to any BR below 8.0, should be prioritized with every missile in the Warrior's capacity). Even the many machine guns on the IS-7 can shred the Warrior apart.\n\nAny tank with heavy machine guns: If possessing the add-on armour modification, simply avoid turning the rear towards them, otherwise the weak rear armour would be easily penetrated. Weaker machine guns of around 7.62 mm calibre can't penetrate the Warrior armour at all, and even 14,5 mm will have some problems penetrating the front of the hull and protected sides, so just destroy them by returning cannon fire and avoiding being hit in the turret. They'll never see it coming.\n\n====Counter-tactics====\n<!--What to expect, if it would be in command of the enemy and how to counter it. (i.e. Just flank)-->\nJust fire at its turret, preferably with explosives or high fire rate guns.\n\nIf it tries to spook away a threat by being ominous and peeking over hills, disable its ATGM camera (on \"ears\") with concentrated fire if a direct hit to the crew and modules is not possible. If hit by explosives, it might cause overpressure damage and destroy the tank outright. Keep in mind that must damage whole IFV really hard for ATGM repairs to take long (otherwise it may take less than rearm time, which is not good).\n\nIf the missile is already homing towards a vehicle with no way to avoid it, try to get outside of direct missile control range by not letting the light tank to aim at you directly (which will make missile spiral crazily and possibly missing by a centimetre) or face it with the gun barrel and fire all machine guns in hopes that it would get shot mid-air or get absorbed by the gun and not damage or destroy any critical modules.\n\nNever fire pure AP rounds to the back of this tank, since unless it hits one of the missile ammo racks there, it will just do nothing to it.\n\nIf the Warrior has the add-on armour package, '''do not''' underestimate it and use anything possible when engaging it, not just HMG. Warrior repairs and reloads fast enough to disable its adversaries, if it must, \"just set it on fire\" mindset is not going to stop it. Low calibre machine guns are useless against hull from front, despite it having incomplete add-on armour protection.\n\nIn case Warrior destroyed your primary weapon, but you still have 12.7 mm machine gun, you can fire at its ventilation to destroy it. It's very well hidden on the right-front side of the IFV (left for you, if facing it) behind a small grey shield, making it nearly unnoticeable. Firing at ventilation from the side is also possible, but it will do less than fatal damage.\n\nThe Warrior can be destroyed by a fighter jet. However, do not just strafe it directly, as it actually can fire back and may have armour. It's best to attack it from the top.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness.

True fresh airs for British tankers!\n* Favourable levels of gun depression vertically and horizontally\n* Turret rotation speed ideal for brawling, especially when dealing with several targets in rapid succession.\n\n'''Cons:'''\n\n* Can be destroyed easily, especially if situation awareness is not maintained; a big visible target\n* Any properly landed turret shot will destroy the vehicle, little chance to survive if it was a HE shell\n* Add-on armour heavily depends on enemy being inaccurate and each side panel will only save the tank once\n* Engine exhaust placement (front right corner of tank) obscure gunners thermal vision when looking between approximately 45° and 80° to the right.\n* No stabilization for the turret greatly affects firing capacities. Disheartening performance on duels\n\n== History ==\n<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction.

The vehicle went into series production in 1986. The vehicle was equipped with 30 mm gun, fed by magazines of three shells each. This gun was designed to destroy lightly armoured vehicles with maximum accuracy. For the Desert Storm operation, the Warriors were equipped with Chobham passive armour – add-on armour plates that significantly improved the IFV's defence in battle, allowing it to survive a hit from an RPG-7 grenade and shrapnel from high-calibre HE rounds. A little later, in 1990, the military decided to equip the Warrior with anti-tank weaponry – a 30 mm gun for these targets was clearly not enough. The roof of the turret was equipped with a launcher for the MILAN ATGM. The commander used a hatch to fire the ATGM, and it was reloaded through the upper hatch of the armoured vehicle's infantry compartment. The FV510 Warrior is still in service with the British army and is the main IFV of the United Kingdom.\n\n''- From [[wt:en/news/5753-development-fv510-warrior-built-for-the-future-en|Devblog]]''\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=uk_fv510_isv Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|y_BcBzYVOeU|'''The Shooting Range #116''' - ''Metal Beasts'' section at 00:35 discusses the Warrior.|2h5kFyznXKU|'''Best IFVs''' discusses the {{PAGENAME}} at 2:15 - ''War Thunder Official Channel''|18Nl66ImFU4|'''British IFV - WARRIOR Suffocating Meta (War Thunder Tanks Gameplay)''' - ''PhlyDaily''|JkgAzKSNIME|'''{{PAGENAME}} Tank Review''' - ''Napalmratte''}}\n\n== See also ==\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wt:en/news/5753-development-fv510-warrior-built-for-the-future-en|[Devblog] FV510 Warrior: Built for the future!]]\n\n{{Britain light tanks}}\n[[Category:ATGM vehicles]]"}}
