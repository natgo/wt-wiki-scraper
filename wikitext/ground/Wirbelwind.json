In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} German Self-Propelled Anti-Aircraft (SPAA) vehicle {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.43]].\n\nThe Flakpanzer IV Wirbelwind is a anti-aircraft platform on a Panzer IV chassis. Armed with quad 20 mm FlaK38 cannons, this machine will absolutely obliterate any enemy plane that's unfortunate enough to cross paths with it. Due to the high fire rate, this machine effectively spews out a river of fragmentation rounds. Any airplane unfortunate enough to even touch that stream will at least burst into flames, if not more severe damage. However, they are incredibly easy to spot because of the tracers. While an individual 20 mm shell does not do much damage, it is very hard when using the Wirbelwind to hit an aircraft with only one shell. The sheer number of shells fired can overwhelm enemy aircraft and act like a laser, cutting off pieces and burning others. This tank, considering its BR, has the potential to be a viable anti-tank thanks to having about 60 mm of penetration. If a Sherman is caught from the flank, you can very much destroy it entirely.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection.

Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->\n\nThe armour surrounding the turret can provide a small amount of protection against plane machine guns, but the amount of armour on its turret is still low and it has an open top so it's best to destroy the attacking plane quickly or move out of the way.\n\n'''Armour type:'''\n* Rolled homogeneous armour\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\n\nBeing the first anti-aircraft of a modified Panzer IV, it is superior to the previous vehicle, the [[Sd.Kfz. 6/2|3.7-cm Flak 36 auf Selbstfahrlafette Sd.Kfz. 6/2]] in many areas and has little to none disadvantages. One notable disadvantage would be the lack of penetration of API-T rounds compared to the prior 3,7 cm cannon. It is recommended to stay away from areas of combat as your quad 20's will do practically nothing against the front plates of heavier armoured enemies at its rank, against which its only defence is to blind enemy vehicles with a barrage of fire and hope allies will neutralize the threat. However, firing a stream of HVAP-T rounds into an enemy's side plates can lead to a very fast elimination.\n\nIn terms of advantages with the 20 mm autocannons, the quad-mount gives the Wirbelwind the ability to fire a lethal stream of bullets at any pilot who wanders into your sights.\n\n;Anti-Aircraft:\nWhile in tank guns, dispersion (the MOA cone that is used to determine accuracy) is something that is ideally kept to a minimum, this vehicle benefits from it by having shots spread out in a sort of \"shotgun\" effect, rather than having four separate beams of projectiles. This means that if you can get your lead point right, your odds of shredding aircraft with even a momentary burst is exceptional compared to other types of AA present at the ranks that you will be operating this vehicle. Unfortunately, this rapid-fire ability is hindered by the 20 round magazine capacity for each cannon (for a total of 80 rounds), meaning that it is best to fire 3-5 round bursts to make effective use of what ammunition you have and your magazine size. This is one of the few areas the Wirbelwind is caught lacking, the others being an open crew compartment roof and the fact that your SPAA houses most of its crew in a thinly armoured turret.\n\nSome of these disadvantages with the Wirbelwind can be mitigated by working with another SPAA. Two Wirbelwinds about 30m apart prove a daunting combination to enemy aircraft as their crossed streams maximize their ability to hit and it is very hard to neutralise both in one go. Besides doubling their spotting ability — when one sees the other firing, he or she will be quick to acquire the same target and proceed to severely worsen the aeroplane's day. For this reason, as a matter of etiquette, do not fire into the air if you do not see anyone, so as not to mislead your teammates.\n\n;Attack:\nIt is highly discouraged to use the Wirbelwind aggressively since it can be hard to always get such a favourable engagement (and also it is not the SPAA's job to do so). However, should a player choose such an attack plan, they should consider either being supported by friendly tanks as an additional gun or cover, or flanking wide and make effective use of cover and concealment against thin-skinned vehicles. Use roads less-traveled to remain hidden. No matter which manoeuvre that is used, stay vigilant for enemy aircraft to avoid them spotting and pouncing on the Wirbelwind. Even if equipped with the PzGr 40 belt for anti-tank purposes, eighty 20 mm shells from the Wirbelwind can still mess up an aircraft's flight time.\n\nOnce the question of manoeuvring to an advantageous position is answered, the next concern is seeing if the 20 mm have enough firepower to be of any threat to the enemy downrange. While the PzGr 40 APCR belt can be a threat to enemy light tank, lightly armoured tank destroyers like the [[M18 GMC|M18 Hellcat]], and also enemy anti-air vehicle, the shell's penetration decreases drastically at range and it's not enough to deal with more heavily armoured vehicles, with the side armour of some medium tanks even being a questionable option. The Wirbelwind's armour is only enough to reduce the damage done by aeroplanes, which makes engaging any sort of tank very dangerous. As such, pick targets wisely and make sure to either take them out within one belt's worth of shells or hold fire to avoid drawing any attention at all.\n\n==== Against the Wirbelwind ====\n* '''Aircraft''': the Wirbelwind is an extremely popular SPAA in Ground Realistic battles and pose a huge threat to any plane, thus every pilot should know how to counter it. Aircraft with access to rockets (eg. P-47D, IL-2) can practice firing off a salvo of rockets at long distances, this way the pilot can score hits/critical hits if not a kill without even entering the effective range of the 20 mm autocannons. Bomb-carrying planes, for example BTD-1, P-47D, will be more dangerous, as they usually need to get closer to drop the bombs accurately. The conventional method of shallow dive bombing will not work if the Wirbelwind knows your presence and starts spraying bursts towards you as you dive, 1-2 hits from it and your wing will snap off. Pilots can try flying low to the ground - at tree-top level if they can, to avoid getting spotted by the SPAA. On occasion, the opposing team, being usually the Allies, will have aircraft with huge cannons, like the XA-38 and Yak-9K. In this case, practising long-range shooting with these plane cannons can definitely help, since you want to finish your pass as quick as possible so you do not get too close to the Wirbelwind. Its armour can overall be easily penetrated by most aircraft armaments, except the frontal hull.\n\n* '''Light tank/SPAA''': light tanks generally see the Wirbelwind as a nice target if their cannon is effective, for example the M24. Other countries' SPAAs usually cannot quickly kill a Wirbelwind from the front, because its hull can reach 100 mm thick which no SPAA at this tier can pierce through. It is best to focus fire on its thin turret, clean out every crew inside, wait for ~12 seconds so it finishes replenishing new crew, and wipe out the new crew again, destroying the Wirbelwind. Perform this task carefully, though, as the Wirbelwind has access to a HVAP belt with ~48 mm penetration, allowing it to penetrate almost all light vehicles without a problem.\n\n* '''Medium tank/heavy tank/tank destroyer''': these vehicles will have no issue destroying a Wirbelwind, it is an SPAA after all. Note, do not shoot the frontal hull armour if it is angling, your shell might fail to penetrate if its penetration is not high enough. Also certain tank destroyers (eg. M10, M18, SU-85) should be careful as their armour have weakspots that can be penetrated by Wirbelwind's PzGr.40 HVAP belt.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics.

The growing air power of the Allies forced the Germans to develop methods to protect their tank formations from strafing from Allied aircraft, one early design to protect the front line tanks was the ''Flakpanzer IV Mobelwagen'', an interim design as Flakpanzer designs underwent development. SS-Hauptsturmführer Karl Wilhelm Krause of the 12th SS Panzer Division came up with the concept of the '''Flakpanzer IV Wirbelwind''' in the summer of 1944. The commander of the 12th SS Panzer Regiment, SS-Obersturmbannführer Max Wünsche, received this and presented it to Hitler, to which he approved for its development.[[File:German SPAA Wirbelwind (2-426).jpg|right|x200px|thumb|none|A camouflaged Wirbelwind.]]\n\nThe design called for use of the proven Panzer IV design. The Wirbelwind uses the Panzer IV hull, but the original Panzer IV turret was removed and replaced with an open-topped nine-sided turret that mounted the anti-aircraft armament. The anti-aircraft armament chosen for the vehicle was a quadruple mounted 2 cm FlaK 38. Though a closed-top turret design was desired, the number of gasses given out by the gun made this impossible for the crew. The production of the Wirbelwind commenced at the Ostbau Werke at Sagan, Silesia. Between 87 to 105 Wirbelwinds were manufactured from May to November 1944, with the discrepancies due to differences in the Wehrmacht service records and Ostbau Werke's production records.\n\n===Combat usage===\n[[File:Wirbelwind_CFB_Borden.jpg|left|thumb|x200px|A surviving Wirbelwind.]]\nThe troops nicknamed the Wirbelwind the ''\"Keksdose\"'' (Biscuit Tin) due to its unique turret shape. The Wirbelwind was equipped with Panzer formations to protect them against low-flying aircraft. During the Battle of Normandy in 1944, flak units in the 12th SS Panzer Division were credited with shooting down 45 allied planes. However, there weren't enough to go around in the front-lines so many Panzer formations were left vulnerable to enemy aircraft due to lack of availability of the Flakpanzers. Not only did their small numbers made their effect on the front minimal, but the 20 mm cannon was also determined to insufficient against the more armoured aircraft that the Allies are fielding. Thus, the design was changed to not use the quadruple 2 cm Flak 38, but instead the 3.7 cm FlaK 43 in the new designation [[Ostwind|Flakpanzer IV Ostwind]]. Aside from that the Wirbelwind also served as a ground support role, which it proved very well at with its rapid firing 20 mm cannons.\n\nIt was determined that the Flakpanzer IV in the ''Wirbelwind'' and ''Ostwind'' configurations were to be replaced by the [[Kugelblitz]] by early 1945, in an attempt to yet again increase the firepower of the anti-aircraft guns. But this never happened due to the war ending before the Kugelblitz could be deployed.\n\n=== In-game description ===\nAfter losing air superiority, the Wehrmacht needed to improve the AA weapons of its armored tank divisions. The Wirbelwind AA vehicle was built on the chassis of the Pz.IV tank. It was the first specialized, self-sufficient means of defending armored tank divisions against enemy aircraft. The Flakvierling 38 installation was placed in an open turret protected by 16 mm of armor plating. Unlike various other self-propelled AA systems, this AA weapon struck a balance between protection, deployment time, and firepower. Between July, 1944 and March, 1945 105 of these mounts were built. They were used on the Western and Eastern Fronts. The first prototype was built on the basis of a remodeled Pz.IV by Krupp-Druckenmuller GmbH Berlin-Mariendorf in May, 1944.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicleCountry=germany&vehicleType=tank&vehicleClass=spaa&vehicle=germ_flakpanzer_IV_Wirbelwind Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Images\n<gallery mode=\"packed-hover\"  heights=\"200\">\nImage:Wirbelwind looking for planes.jpg|<small>The Wirbelwind scanning the sky for target aircraft.</small>\n</gallery>\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|naeDoEwZ5Pg|'''German SPAAs''' discusses the {{PAGENAME}} at 2:22 - ''War Thunder Official Channel''|8GHgtBsV32M|'''Aviation industry HATES it!
