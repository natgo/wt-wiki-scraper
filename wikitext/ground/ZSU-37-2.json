In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Soviet SPAA {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update \"Hot Tracks\"]].\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->\nSharing the same hull of the [[SU-100P]], the hull is protected enough for heavy machine gun fire but lacks protection against everything else. However, the turret is barely armoured for low calibre machine gun fire (with only 8.9mm of thickness), it has little survivability against everything it will face and will be destroyed by overpressure with most CE ammunition (HE, ATGM, rockets, bombs, etc.)\n\n'''Armour type:'''\n* Rolled homogeneous armour (hull, turret)\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

It does benefit from regenerative steering, reducing the speed loss when turning but not as much as with neutral steering. The reverse speed is good enough to enable you to disengage easily and play peek-a-boo with the enemy.\n\n=== Modifications and economy ===\n{{Specs-Economy}}\n\n== Armaments ==\n{{Specs-Tank-Armaments}}\n=== Main armament ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Weapon|1}}\n<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun.

Give advice on how to use them and how to fill the ammunition storage.'' -->\n{{main|2A11 (37 mm)}}\n\nThis tank has access to a double mount of Shipunov 2A11 37 mm autocannon, a very versatile weapon, considering its vertical guidance, traverse speed, and selection of ammo belts. It is similar to the one seen on the [[BMP-2]]. Due to being double mount, it has an RPM of 1,000. It is devastating against both aircraft and ground vehicles even with the standard AP round. It does not get access to APDS belts like on the 2A45 30 mm autocannon but the AP belts are more than enough to disable and destroy modules from all angles as well as destroy enemy tanks from the sides.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"100%\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"6\" | [[2A11 (37 mm)|37 mm 2A11]] (x2) || colspan=\"5\" | Turret rotation speed (°/s) || colspan=\"4\" | Reloading rate (seconds)\n|-\n!

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\nThe ZSU-37-2 should be played entirely as an AA vehicle. Do not go tank hunting in this vehicle, as you do not have the armour. Focus on keeping the skies clear, something that this vehicle does very well. A high rate of fire and very fast turret traverse means that you should be able to target and destroy even the fastest jets.\n\nYou have a high ammo count with this vehicle, meaning that you can afford to find a good spot away from the main fight in order to pick off enemy planes. Unless you need to reload your ammo, avoid capture points. They are usually the hub of most of the fighting and going to them will put you in the firing line.\n\nWhile it is fully enclosed, the ZSU-37-2 has armour which makes the M18 Hellcat look like a heavy tank. Even 7.62 mm machine guns stand a fair chance of penetrating this vehicle. This makes you a primary target for aircraft, which are usually armed with cannons or high penetration machine guns and will easily take you out.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics.

It was developed by Uralmashzavod based on the SU-100P chassis designated Object 119. The ZSU-37-2 was meant to counter targets at 3km. A single prototype vehicle was built and was tested on December 1960, both ZSU-23-4 and ZSU-37-2 were accepted for service. It never saw service as the ZSU-23-4 was preferred as an SPAA\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=ussr_zsu_37_2 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|fIlUeGLTF7w|'''The Shooting Range #238''' - ''Metal Beasts'' section at 00:30 discusses the {{PAGENAME}}.|10seZ_m4t-k|'''ZSU-37-2 - When Gaijin Cheaps Out Again''' - ''Napalmratte''|XI561HYbJPc|'''ZSU-37-2 [Profile]''' - ''BaconGaming''}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n;Vehicles equipped with the same chassis\n* [[SU-100P]]\n* [[Object 120]]\n\n;Other vehicles of similar configuration and role\n* [[ZSU-23-4]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [https://en.topwar.ru/5760-zsu-37-2-enisey-ne-shilkoy-edinoy.html <nowiki>[Topwar.ru]</nowiki> ZSU-37-2 \"Yenisei\".
