It was introduced in [[Update 1.43]]. It is based on a SU-76M chassis with a special turret mounting the 37 mm 61-K mod. 1939 anti-aircraft cannon. Its fast-firing cannon will bring down any plane coming at range and thanks to its HVAP ammunition it also has the potential to destroy tanks with around 100 mm penetration.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection.

Air targets should be the ZSU-37's main priority. The ZSU-37 has thin armour and low survivability, but it should stay near friendly tanks, as it may prove useful in supporting them with its cannon. Staying near the front can also help with shooting down enemy aircraft, as the ZSU-37 will be close to them when they make attack runs on friendly vehicles.\n\n'''Tips:'''\n\nThe ZSU-37 is best used as a second or third spawn, because aircraft will not spawn at the beginning of the match. Do not engage aircraft too early, as you will only expose yourself. Begin firing at no more than 1-1.5 km range for the best effect. Always watch out for multiple aircraft, as one may hit you with bombs or rockets while you are distracted. The gun is surprisingly potent, and will quickly dispatch most air targets after a few hits, even against heavy fighters and bombers. The 37 mm gun does have a somewhat slow fire rate, so it may be difficult to hit enemy aircraft. It is a good idea to learn the weak spots of enemy ground vehicles you will commonly face near the ZSU-37's BR, as knowing these will allow the ZSU-37 to penetrate enemy tanks with more ease.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as \"bad\", \"good\" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as \"inadequate\" and \"effective\".'' -->\n\n'''Pros:'''\n\n* Single 37 mm 61-K cannon is capable of completely destroying enemy aircraft with only one or two hits\n* Great anti-armour performance with AP belts of ~60 mm and HVAP-T belts of ~90 mm penetration at close range, allowing the vehicle to engage lightly armoured vehicles easily from the front, and more heavily armoured ones through their sides or rear\n* Very fast reload; able to fire almost constantly until the ammo storage is empty\n\n'''Cons:'''\n\n* Crew members are very vulnerable to aerial strafing and tank machine gun fire due to open-top construction\n* Struggles in rough terrain and steering is very stiff due to low engine power\n* Slow, sluggish, and cumbersome\n* Turret rotation is very slow\n* Vulnerable to overpressure\n* Very weak protection\n* Large ammo racks\n* Low fire rate can make hitting aircraft very difficult\n* Bad stock grind\n\n== History ==\n<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the vehicle in more detail than in the introduction. If the historical reference turns out to be too long, take it to a separate article, taking a link to the article about the vehicle and adding a block \"/History\" (example: <nowiki>https://wiki.warthunder.com/(Vehicle-name)/History</nowiki>) and add a link to it here using the <code>main</code> template. Be sure to reference text and sources by using <code><nowiki><ref></ref></nowiki></code>, as well as adding them at the end of the article with <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code>. This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->\n\n=== In-game description ===\nSince tank divisions were facing greater losses from attacks by enemy assault aircraft, the decision was made to create a self-propelled anti-air mount based on light tanks. Work on the creation of a self-propelled installation based on the T-70 tank began in 1942. Two experimental models were released. Serious design flaws were uncovered during the testing phase.\n\nIn December, 1943 the ZSU-37 SPG was built at Factory #38 under the management of M.N. Shukin. It was armed with a 37mm KB M.N. Loginov 61-K AA cannon. The vehicle was based on the SU-76M SPG, but instead of a combat cockpit they installed an open, rotating turret. An experimental model of the vehicle successfully underwent state-run testing and was recommended for serial production. However, due to production difficulties, serial production was moved to Factory #40 in Mytishchi.\n\nThe vehicle's design was enhanced at the new factory, and, after undergoing testing in October-November 1944, the vehicle began to be released serially. The vehicle was released in a small series of 75 units from 1945-1946. It was never used in combat.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=ussr_zsu_37 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|yHDVziBYo5g|'''Spade Review: {{PAGENAME}}.
