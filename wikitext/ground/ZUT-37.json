In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium rank {{Specs|rank}} Soviet self-propelled anti-aircraft gun {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.43]].\n\nDespite its status as a SPAA, a 37 mm autocannon atop a T-70 chassis can lead the {{PAGENAME}} to perform a multi-role function as anti-aircraft and anti-armours as the selected ammunition permit.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->\nThe {{PAGENAME}} has no hull armour difference from its base model [[T-70]]. However, given that the {{PAGENAME}}'s higher battle rating, the hull armour may seem insufficient against the new types of enemies encountered.\n\nThe biggest downgrade in armour is the turret. While the T-70 can be somewhat comfortable with a 50 mm gun mantlet and 35 mm armour plates for the turret construction, the {{PAGENAME}} is composed of only 16 mm plates all-around. This means even heavy machine guns can penetrate and knock out the gunner in the turret. The open-top construction of the vehicle compounds the turret vulnerability by making artillery shrapnel and aircraft able to defeat the ZUT-37.\n\nThe gunner's vulnerability is hazardous for the {{PAGENAME}}'s lifespan as it only has two crew members, and so the gunner's incapacitation would lead to the vehicle's demise or transition into Crew Replenishment mode. These features would encourage a more subtle gameplay with the ZUT-37 to make the most of concealment and cover to reduce the threat of being shot from the ground or sky.\n\n'''Armour type:'''\n\n* Rolled homogeneous armour\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Otherwise, if you are in close range (less than 50 m), just fire off the whole magazine and run, looking for cover while waiting for the gun to reload. Remaining out in the open while reloading puts a large bulls-eye on the tank for anyone to attack.\n\n==== Ammunition ====\n\n* '''Default:''' {{Annotation|AP-T|Armour-piercing tracer}}{{-}}{{Annotation|HEFI-T*|High-explosive fragmentation incendiary tracer (self-destroying)}} - These rounds work well for either use (anti-air or against armour) until the others are researched.

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\n\nThe ZUT-37 can be used in multiple roles, as a tank and as an AA battery. Its weapon has enough penetration for its BR to be used in light tank roles. It has very few rounds in each magazine, but if it hits it causes devastating damage to the plane.\n\nOne thing to take account when using the ZUT-37 is handling. The T-70 chassis is already somewhat unstable to drive, and this modification is not an improvement. It takes a considerable time for the suspension to settle from any substantial braking, leaving the vehicle unable to shoot accurately for some seconds. Is no use for shooting on the move because of this.\n\nThis vehicle also proves to be very helpful in SB or RB as a scout tank. The very good speed and acceleration allow you to quickly rush a contested point, or to quickly spot enemies once the round starts. Make sure to use the low profile to spot targets while moving through trenches or simply spotting over a small hill.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics.

This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->\nIn the Summer of 1942, the design bureau at Plant No.37 attempted to create an anti-aircraft tank. N.A. Popov had the tank design based on the light tank [[T-70]] and was supposed to mount a 37 mm gun Sh-37 gun autocannon originally developed for the IL-2 plane. constructed by Boris G. Shpitalny. The muzzle velocity of the gun was 1000 m/s with 200 rounds stored inside the tank, and the gun can fire at a rate of 170 - 185 rpm.\n\nThe ZUT-37 was capable of firing both at air and ground targets due to the equipping of a telescopic sight and red dot sighting on the tank. The gun traversed on two special racks. The vehicle was not put into production because of the unfavourable arrangement of the crew compartment and was shelved.\n\n=== In-game description ===\nThe ZUT-37 anti-air tank was an enhanced version of the project by B. Shpitalny that was built in June, 1942 on the chassis of the T-70. The enhanced model underwent testing in December 1942 – January 1943. In general it passed the tests. Among the conclusions drawn from the results of the tests was the possibility of building an experimental batch of ZUT-37s once certain observations regarding the Sh-37 cannon had been rectified. However, this project was abandoned.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=ussr_zut_37 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|V9MwcVDYdeY|'''{{PAGENAME}} Tank Review''' - ''NUSensei''|PosWOnOGkSo|'''Best experimental vehicles''' discusses the {{PAGENAME}} at 7:28 - ''War Thunder Official Channel''}}\n\n== See also ==\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wt:en/devblog/current/627|[Devblog] ZUT-37]]\n\n{{USSR anti-aircraft vehicles}}\n{{USSR premium ground vehicles}}"}}
