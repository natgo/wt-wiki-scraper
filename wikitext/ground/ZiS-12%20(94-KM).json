In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' (94-KM gun mount on a ZIS-12 truck) is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Soviet self-propelled anti-aircraft vehicle {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.57 \"Battle March\"]].\n\nThe 94-KM is an improvement over the [[GAZ-MM (72-K)]] with its dual-mounted 25 mm cannons, increasing its rate of fire and area of saturation for anti-aircraft duties.\n\nThis SPAA is commonly referred to as the \"Milk Truck\" by the community.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->\nThe armour of the ZiS-12 (as seen in prior models) is inexistent even for shrapnel. Thus, the commander should always avoid or shoot to kill whatever enemy he sees. Not only for the fact the main gun is able to destroy the SPAA in a single shot but also because even low calibre machine gun fire is able to destroy the vehicle, specially on the vehicle turret as it is open. All aircraft will be able to get easy kills with this if the commander is unaware of aircraft existence. Being an open vehicle with milimetrical thickness armour invites all enemy players to use machine guns to kill it.\n\n'''Armour type:'''\n\n* Structural steel\n* Wood (Truck bed)\n* Rolled homogeneous armour (Gun mount)\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Armour !! Front !! Sides !! Rear !! Roof\n|-\n| Driver's cabin || 1 mm || 1 mm || 1 mm || 1 mm\n|-\n| Cargo bed || 15 mm || 15 mm || 15 mm || 15 mm\n|-\n|}\n'''Notes:'''\n\n* The wheels are 2 mm thick.\n* The truck bed is 15 mm of wood, which will probably not offer as much protection as the truck cab.\n* The radiator housing is unarmoured.\n\n=== Mobility ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}\n<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->\n\n{{tankMobility|abMinHp=99|rbMinHp=62}}\n\nThe mobility of the ZiS-12 is not exactly the fastest but is not mediocre either. When used on roads, top speeds are really high and is able to reach speeds of 80km/h. When off-road, the ZiS-12 will struggle, not much but speed will be drastically reduced compared to roads. Mud, water, sand and snow are the worst enemies of tires, mainly for the treaction for said environments. When in maps in which sand or snow are inevitable (Sands of Sinai for example) always stay on or close to a road.\n\n=== Modifications and economy ===\n{{Specs-Economy}}\n\nThe most important module for this anti-air vehicle is arguably the OZR-132 full-HE ammo belt, which greatly improves the cannon's anti-air abilities. Since the vehicle has practically no armour, it usually finds little success in an anti-tank role, so the BR-132 modification is not as useful, even though it gives the vehicle high-penetrating rounds. Similarly, mobility upgrades are not a top priority when it comes to modules for the ZiS-12.\n\n== Armaments ==\n{{Specs-Tank-Armaments}}\n=== Main armament ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Weapon|1}}\n<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun. Assess its effectiveness in a battle based on the reloading speed, ballistics and the power of shells. Do not forget about the flexibility of the fire, that is how quickly the cannon can be aimed at the target, open fire on it and aim at another enemy. Add a link to the main article on the gun: <code><nowiki>{{main|Name of the weapon}}</nowiki></code>. Describe in general terms the ammunition available for the main gun. Give advice on how to use them and how to fill the ammunition storage.'' -->\n{{main|72-K (25 mm)}}\n\nThe ZiS-12 (94-KM) is armed with dual 25 mm autocannons, devastating for all armoured vehicles seen at the battle rating. The calibre and penetration is not the most fearful characteristic of this weapons, the fire rate and RPM is. Due to being dual mount, the RPM is elevated to 480. At first sight this may not be seen as a threat but depending on the ammunition used, the ZiS-12 is able to either play anti-tank or anti-air role. The RPM helps not only in scaring enemy planes but also to redirect fire upon missed shots. A single hit to an aircraft with this weapons will be fatal, even with the AP belt.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"100%\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"6\" | [[72-K (25 mm)|25 mm 72-K]] (x2) || colspan=\"5\" | Turret rotation speed (°/s) || colspan=\"4\" | Reloading rate (seconds)\n|-\n!

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\nThis anti-aircraft gun is used similarly as the 72-K GAZ MM and is armed with not one, but two 25 mm cannons that dish out twice the damage. Get to a good vantage point using the vehicle's speed, and then use the cannons to shoot down aircraft that threaten the team. Beware of any tanks or aircraft, as even machine guns can destroy the vehicle. If faced with light tanks, try to run away with the high speed of the vehicle, or try to destroy it using the cannons. The 25 mm's will offer enough penetration to go through most of a light tank's armour. A good strategy might be to flank the enemy team or an individual and attack it from the side. Caution should be paid to what tank you are shooting at, although the AP clip is effective against the side armour of most tanks this vehicle will be up against. Heavy tanks should be avoided, unless the ZiS-12 is serving as a distraction for the team or you are sure that you can pen their armour. Again, being shot by anything will often result in your vehicle being destroyed or put out of action. Although this vehicle is speedy, speed alone will not be enough to avoid enemy shots and machine-gun fire. One way to help mitigate the damage your vehicle might take in an engagement is by reversing up a hill, depressing your barrels over the ridge, only exposing two of your four crew members. Even if you do get shot, the driver and commander will usually survive, allowing you to escape.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in a bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics.

Their self-propelled anti-aircraft guns are mainly improvised truck beds mounting a light anti-aircraft gun, such as Maxim machine guns on the [[GAZ-AAA (4M)]] and a single 25 mm autocannon in the [[GAZ-MM (72-K)]]. By the end of 1943, the design bureau at Plant no.88 wanted to mount two 25 mm 72-K guns onto a truck bed. The guidance system on the new design was derived from the 37 mm 61-K gun. The gun system was mounted onto the back of a ZIS-12 truck bed, which was derived from the ZIS-5 truck. In 1944, the weapon system was accepted for testing and later approved as the '''94-KM ZIS-12'''. Plant no.88 produced the 94-KM from 1944 to 1945 before stopping at either production number 225 or 237, possibly due to the introduction of the better [[ZSU-37]] anti-aircraft system.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicleCountry=ussr&vehicleType=tank&vehicleClass=spaa&vehicle=ussr_zis_12_94KM_1945 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|CwL60msiuos|'''{{PAGENAME}} Tank Review''' - ''NUSensei''}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n;Vehicles equipped with the same gun\n\n* [[GAZ-MM (72-K)]]\n\n;Other vehicles of similar configuration and role\n\n* [[Sd.Kfz. 6/2]]\n* [[CCKW 353 AA]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wt:en/devblog/current/888|[Devblog] 94-KM SPAAG]]\n\n{{USSR anti-aircraft vehicles}}\n[[Category:Wheeled ground vehicles]]"}}
