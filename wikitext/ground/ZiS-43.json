In the second part, tell the reader about the ground vehicle in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Soviet self-propelled anti-aircraft vehicle {{Battle-rating}}. This SPAAG was introduced in [[Update 1.65 \"Way of the Samurai\"]]. A 37 mm cannon placed in an anti-aircraft turret on a ZiS-42M half-track chassis, the ZIS-43 was a prototype built in November 1942 which underwent testing but never entered production.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Survivability and armour ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Armour}}\n<!-- ''Describe armour protection. Note the most well protected and key weak areas. Appreciate the layout of modules as well as the number and location of crew members. Is the level of armour protection sufficient, is the placement of modules helpful for survival in combat? If necessary use a visual template to indicate the most secure and weak zones of the armour.'' -->\nThe ZiS-43's armour is nonexistent and can barely withstand 12.7 mm machine gun fire. Thus, much like the rest of SPAA in the game, it is really fragile and the armour should not be relied on. Every plane is a threat that has to be taken seriously as the turret is open and only has a small 15 mm shield which barely provides protection against 7.62 mm machine gun fire. Almost all bomb fragmentation is able to penetrate and damage crew members. Some bombs, depending on the explosive power and fragmentation radius, may not knock out crew members. However they will often damage them and leave them in a yellow-orange status.\n\n'''Armour type:'''\n\n* Rolled homogeneous armour\n* Structural steel (Gun mount)\n* Wood (Truck bed)\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

They are fully exposed in the rear and above.\n\n=== Mobility ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Mobility}}\n<!-- ''Write about the mobility of the ground vehicle. Estimate the specific power and manoeuvrability, as well as the maximum speed forwards and backwards.'' -->\n\n{{tankMobility|abMinHp=128|rbMinHp=80}}\n\nSimilar to the [[M16 MGMC|M16]] SPAA, being a halftrack is a mid-point between wheel speed and track traction. It is far from being the fastest halftrack in game. However, it does provide increased traction when it comes to rough terrain, is not comparable to full tracked vehicles but is better than fully wheeled vehicles seen at the battle-rating. Being a halftrack leaves it with a \"semi tank turn\" capacity, meaning tracks are able to help steer but will not do so completely as the steering is given from the frontal wheels.\n\n=== Modifications and economy ===\n{{Specs-Economy}}\n\n== Armaments ==\n{{Specs-Tank-Armaments}}\n=== Main armament ===\n{{Specs-Tank-Weapon|1}}\n<!-- ''Give the reader information about the characteristics of the main gun. Assess its effectiveness in a battle based on the reloading speed, ballistics and the power of shells. Do not forget about the flexibility of the fire, that is how quickly the cannon can be aimed at the target, open fire on it and aim at another enemy. Add a link to the main article on the gun: <code><nowiki>{{main|Name of the weapon}}</nowiki></code>. Describe in general terms the ammunition available for the main gun. Give advice on how to use them and how to fill the ammunition storage.'' -->\n{{main|61-K (37 mm)}}\n\nThe ZiS-43 is armed with a quick firing 37mm which is more than capable to deal with both aircraft and ground targets, but just like other low rate of fire SPAA it requires the player to shoot accurately in order to do well. Since it has a slow traverse speed, it is tricky to aim with the ZiS-43 when it comes to short distances between aircraft and SPAA. This can be countered by engaging enemy aircraft at distances. However, this is a game changer when it comes to ground fight. Turret rotation speed is the difference between life or death for various reasons: exposed crew, not being able to counterattack quickly, tank traverse is painfully slow. At least unlike previous SPAAs, the driver's cabin no longer gets in the way of the gun allowing you to shoot ground targets right in front of the vehicle.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"100%\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"6\" | [[61-K (37 mm)|37 mm 61-K]] || colspan=\"5\" | Turret rotation speed (°/s) || colspan=\"4\" | Reloading rate (seconds)\n|-\n!

It has enough penetration to go through all medium tanks from the sides when up close and some more vulnerable ones can even be penetrated from the front (such as [[Pz.IV F2]] ). It does not have any explosive filler, but rate of fire is enough that you can simply spray multiple shots around the target's sides.\n\nSince every bullet is a tracer, firing makes you easily detected by enemy airplanes and tanks.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"100%\"\n! colspan=\"7\" | Penetration statistics\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" data-sort-type=\"text\" | Belt\n! colspan=\"6\" | Penetration @ 0° Angle of Attack (mm)\n|-\n! 10 m !! 100 m !! 500 m !! 1,000 m !! 1,500 m !! 2,000 m\n|-\n| Default || 70 || 68 || 56 || 45 || 36 || 29\n|-\n| UO-167 || 3 || 3 || 3 || 3 || 3 || 3\n|-\n| BR-167 || 70 || 68 || 56 || 45 || 36 || 29\n|-\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"100%\"\n! colspan=\"10\" | Belt details\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" data-sort-type=\"text\" | Belt\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Type of<br>warhead\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Velocity<br>(m/s)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Projectile<br>Mass (kg)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Fuse delay<br>(m)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Fuse sensitivity<br>(mm)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Explosive Mass<br>(TNT equivalent) (g)\n! colspan=\"3\" | Ricochet\n|-\n! 0% !! 50% !! 100%\n|-\n| UO-167 || HEFI-T* || 866 || 0.73 || 0 || 0.1 || 56.98 || 79° || 80° || 81°\n|-\n| BR-167 || AP-T || 868 || 0.77 || N/A || N/A || N/A || 47° || 60° || 65°\n|-\n|}\n\n==== [[Ammo racks]] ====\n[[File:Ammoracks_{{PAGENAME}}.png|right|thumb|x250px|[[Ammo racks]] of the {{PAGENAME}}]]\n<!-- '''Last updated: 1.101.1.16''' -->\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!

It is poorly armoured, tall, slow and unstable. If necessary, it is possible to penetrate most vehicles sides or rear but sticking to anti-aircraft duty will yield the best results. Do not stay in spawn however, most planes will attack your teammates busy fighting instead of you. Similar to previous seen SPAA, they have really good capabilities for both anti-air and anti-ground duties. However, despite being a higher calibre than the previously seen 25 mm and 14.5 mm, it lacks the ROF to engage targets ''as fast'' as the other SPAAs.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness.

This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->\n\nThe GAU (Russian: Главное артиллерийское управление, English: Main Artillery Directorate) set forth a requirement for an anti-aircraft vehicle using a 37 mm AA gun on a ZiS-42 half-track on 14 November 1942. The requirements stated that it was to have armour protection for the engine and cabin, and also was to have an armoured shield for the gun mount. The requirements also gave a maximum weight of 6.5 tons; the vehicle was developed by the ZiS factory in Moscow and was given the designation ZiS-43.\n\nThe ZiS-43 utilized the ZiS-42M half-track chassis with a 37 mm 61-K anti-aircraft gun mounted on the flat bed at the rear. The front half of the weapon mount was protected by armoured shields, the engine compartment was uparmoured, and so was the cabin. All the added armour protection gave the vehicle a weight of 8.75 metric tons. In addition to the weapon system and increased armour, the vehicle included other minor changes in comparison to the ZiS-42 including redesigned grills for increased engine cooling. The sides, as well as the top, of the engine compartment received armoured hatches for ease of maintenance. The cabin was redesigned in order to give the driver more comfortable working conditions, as on other models the driver's position was known to be incredibly uncomfortable.\n\nThe prototype went to trials on 15 December 1942 after driving 380 km to Gorohovets Artillery Proving Grounds from the factory. From the 19th to the 23rd of December, the ZiS-43 prototype was driven over five hundred km. Problems arose with the cooling of the vehicle, with the engine overheating twice during trials and the cabin getting as hot as 50°C. Due to the weight of the ZiS-43, a maximum speed of 35 km/h was achieved on roads and only 19.5 km/h on dirt roads. The average speed was 29.3 km/h on roads and the fuel consumption was as high as 110 litres per 100 km on dirt roads and still a low minimum of 90 litres per 100 km on more favourable terrain. During firing trials a number of other issues were revealed; the headlights would shatter upon firing due to changes in pressure and the high center of gravity caused accuracy issues due to instability.\n\nThe ZiS-43 never entered service thanks to its disappointing performance during trials, leaving production at only one prototype. For an anti-aircraft vehicle such armour was seen as an unnecessary burden, and the program was subsequently cancelled. After the cancellation of the program the armour of the ZiS-43 prototype was removed, returning it to its original state as a ZiS-42M.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=ussr_zis_43 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|6KTz0cQWk2M|'''{{PAGENAME}} Tank Review''' - ''NUSensei''}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the vehicles;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n;Other vehicles of similar configuration and role\n\n* [[Sd.Kfz. 6/2]]\n* [[CCKW 353 AA]]\n* [[Lvtdgb m/40]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wt:en/news/4383-development-zis-43-when-you-need-a-bigger-bang-en/|[Devblog] ZiS-43: When You Need a Bigger Bang]]\n* https://warspot.net/124-halftrack-experiments - Halftrack Experiments on warspot.net\n\n{{USSR anti-aircraft vehicles}}\n[[Category:Half-tracks]]"}}
