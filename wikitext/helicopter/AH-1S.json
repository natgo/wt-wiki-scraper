In the second part, tell the reader about the helicopter in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Japanese attack helicopter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update \"Starfighters\"]].\n\nThis helicopter is the exact same variant as the [[AH-1S Kisarazu]] and comes with a shark mouth skin.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Flight performance ===\n{{Specs-Heli-Flight}}\n<!-- ''Describe how the helicopter behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->\nThe AH-1S has a single turboshaft T53-L-703 power plant, providing up to 1351 BHP & 220 kgf with a mass of 350 kg. This turboshaft engine is able to push the AH-1S to speeds in excess of 277 km/h whilst carrying wing-mounted armaments.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Characteristics\n! colspan=\"2\" | Max Speed<br>(km/h at 1,000 m)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Max altitude<br>(metres)\n|-\n!

Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical systems.'' -->\n\nThe AH-1S is an armoured attack helicopter offering protection to the crew and engine:\n\n* Composite boron carbide seat enclosures, for both of the crew, with a thickness of 20 mm.\n* A steel seat, which offers a thickness of 12 mm for the pilot only.\n* Steel plate covers, offering 12 mm of thickness over the turboshaft engine.\n\nThe AH-1S compensates with its small size compared to the [[Mi-24 (Family)|Mi-24 Hinds]] which are incredibly well armoured but are huge and much less nimble in comparison. However, the AH-1S does not protect all of its critical components, such as the fuel tanks, transmission, propeller shaft, and control surfaces, with armour plating, nor does it have armoured glass installed around the cockpit.\n\n=== Modifications and economy ===\n{{Specs-Economy}}\n\n== Armaments ==\n{{Specs-Heli-Armaments}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\" | [[Ballistic Computer]]\n|-\n!

Refrain from creating a \"guide\" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\nWhen playing the AH-1S, select the helipad which is in the ideal tactical location for your playstyle. Climb to around 1,500 meters, find a target, then descend on to them. For optimal effectiveness, it is important that you engage them from the rear or the side. As pilots primarily scan in front of themselves for targets, attacking from behind will give you the advantage of not being seen. When shadowing the target, approach as fast as possible to close the gap to within TOW range. After slowing, engage the sight stabilizer and fire the TOW missile and guide it to the target.\n\nIf the target tries to evade, keep the missile on the target and adjust to counter any manoeuvres your adversary may attempt.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, if out of TOW range, the missile will self-detonate and could give your position away, if your adversary is attentive and sees the explosion.\n\n{{Notice|Remember you only have around one and a half miles before the missiles will detonate by themselves, you can only select to carry either 4 or 8 BGM-71 TOW missiles.|!}}\n\nAfter gaining experience while playing with the BGM-71 missiles, you will be able to determine when you are within range based on that experience. This also applies to any other type of missile in the game too.\n\nWhen engaging in close quarters combat with other helicopters, the biggest threats are air to air missiles- The AH-1S does not offer any protection against them with countermeasures such as flares or IRCM. This means you need to stay alert, active & on the lookout for fast moving dots. If you see a small fast dot heading towards you, make very sharp abrupt turns, change height at the same time while turning and rolling.\n\n{{Notice|These are the biggest threats to you in battle since they can carry air-to-air missiles|!!}}\n\n* [[AH-1Z|AH-1Z Viper]]\n* [[Mi-24P|Mi-24P Hind]]\n* [[Mi-24V|Mi-24V Hind]]\n* [[SA.341F Gazelle]]\n* [[SA.342M Gazelle]]\n\n{{Notice|You may even be able to shoot down missiles with the installed 20 mm triple rotary M197 cannon.|!}}\n\nWhen engaging other helicopters, the triple barrel rotary cannon makes short work of any adversary. Make sure to load it with the air target belt, aim for critical elements of the rival helicopters such as cockpit, engine and fuel tanks. If you have equipped your helicopter with the additional twin M134 miniguns, bring your target in front of you and open fire. They will obliterate the target and send a flaming wreck to the ground. The fast fire rate will chew through ammo at a rapid rate, but when fully loaded have 3,000 rounds in total. That's 1,500 rounds per mini gun, in addition to the 750 cannon rounds for the M197, potentially up to 3,750 rounds total.\n\n====Ground forces====\n\nWhen playing the AH-1S in ground forces, it is recommended to load up the 8 x BGM-71 TOW-2 missiles + 38 x FFAR Mighty Mouse missiles. The BG-71 will give you the penetration at range in order to terminate tankers and with safety from the anti-aircraft missile equipped anti-air vehicles. It is a wise tactic that anti-aircraft missile equipped anti-air vehicles to be terminated first. Then once terminated, move into the battlefield and dominate the tanks with the 38 x FFAR Mighty Mouse missiles, which can cause a lot of damage and could potentially terminate up to 38 tanks with well-placed shots.\n\nThe ideal tactic is to utilize the helicopter and the terrain. Such as maps which have forests and lots of tree lines, stay low over the trees and select your targets based on the threat to yourself first, then the impact to the team.\n\nFor example, if you have seen no enemy SPAA vehicles or other helicopters, climb in height, hover, then fire one or two missiles. Then quickly break off the hover and move to another part of the map, this way it allows you to stay undetected, remain stealthy and become a major threat to the enemy team.\n\nHandling radar and surface-to-air missiles, when an enemy missile equipped SPAA is achieving a lock on, you will be notified with red arrows on the screen saying radar. To break the lock start rolling, gaining speed and the arrows will go away. If you are not successful, keep a close watch around the helicopter. At this, you will see white smoke coming from the ground, make very sharp abrupt turns. Change height at the same time while turning and rolling to avoid the missile.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as \"bad\", \"good\" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as \"inadequate\" and \"effective\".'' -->\n\n'''Pros:'''\n\n* Great manoeuvrability\n* Very agile, with secondary load outs installed\n* Good secondary weapon loadout\n* IR Thermal vision for cannon/ATGM camera and image intensifier for the pilot/gunner\n* Joystick specific handling characteristics:\n** Easy to recover from adverse roll (retreating blade stall) at high speeds\n** Has SAS mode assistance support (dampening mode only)\n** Good pitch authority at high speeds\n\n'''Cons:'''\n\n* Slow takeoff spool-up and acceleration\n* No missile protection\n* No IRCM\n* No air-to-air missiles\n* Poor missile range of 3.75km (TOW-2 missiles)\n* Somewhat heavy even without additional ordinances\n** Strong tendency to fall into a vortex ring state\n* Joystick specific handling characteristics:\n** Retains energy rather poorly in turns\n** Rotor RPM tends to drop easily\n** Moderately strong adverse roll (retreating blade stall) at high speeds with poor roll control\n** Has a light tendency to nose over but generally doesn't tend to fall into an inverted spin\n** Moderately poor adverse yaw/roll/pitch stability characteristics\n** Center of gravity sits behind the stub wings' center of lift\n\n== History ==\n<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the helicopter in more detail than in the introduction.
