In the second part, tell the reader about the helicopter in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Soviet attack helicopter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update 1.97 \"Viking Fury\"]].\n\n== General info ==\n=== Flight performance ===\n[[File:Ka-29 1.png|thumb|400x400px|Ka-29 landing on the ice.]]\n{{Specs-Heli-Flight}}\n<!-- ''Describe how the helicopter behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->\nIn flight, it is found that the Ka-29 is surprisingly quite manoeuvrable and fast for its size. It can do all sorts of manoeuvres thanks to its powerful Klimov TV3-117V turboshaft engines, thin profile, and coaxial rotor design. The Ka-29 is more than capable of quickly avoiding enemy fire due to this. Oftentimes exceeding 300 km/h, the Ka-29 is also quite fast too. This allows you to get into good positions with [[9M114 Shturm]] missiles or set up for the perfect rocket strike.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Characteristics\n! colspan=\"2\" | Max Speed<br>(km/h at 1,000 m)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Max altitude<br>(metres)\n|-\n!

Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical systems.''-->\n\nThe survivability of the Ka-29 is quite effective, especially in terms of fire control. There is a lot of empty space behind the cockpits and under the engines. Nothing critical lies in the tail either, allowing you to keep flying even if some control surfaces are damaged. Being able to take multiple rounds, the helicopter is great for those lightning quick in-and-out styled missions.\n\n[[File:Ka-29 armour protection.png|thumb|Armour on the Ka-29]]\n\nOne thing to note in the Ka-29 are the fuel tanks. There are 8 of them stored under the cargo bay, in the belly of the helicopter. While they are self-sealing, it is not uncommon for multiple of these fuel tanks to catch on fire from enemy hits. Only a substantial amount of fuel tanks on fire will result in critical components being damaged, so most of the time, the fuel tanks will just burn their capacity of fuel off, and the fire will be put out. Engine fires however are a different story. Similar to the Mi-24 family, the Ka-29 boasts great survivability for its profile.\n\nAs for armour, the helicopter is equipped with bulletproof glass in front of the pilot and gunner, with a thickness of 22 mm. On the doors and surrounding the frontal portion of the helicopter, 8 mm thick steel plating can be found; 3 on each side. The helicopter is not armoured in any other aspect aside from this.\n\n=== Modifications and economy ===\n{{Specs-Economy}}\n\n== Armaments ==\n{{Specs-Heli-Armaments}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\" | [[Ballistic Computer]]\n|-\n!

Refrain from creating a \"guide\" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).''-->\n[[File:Ka-29 5.2.png|thumb|400x400px|Ka-29 hovering over icy waters.]]\nIn Ground RB, with its armament, speed, and manoeuvrability, the Ka-29 is the perfect support helicopter. With the [[9M114 Shturm]] missiles, you'll be able to pick off targets from a distance, more importantly high-profile targets in good positions that may be giving your team a hard time. Eight Shturms is more than enough to destroy a great amount of enemies. If you run out of ATGMs, it is advised to return to the helipad and re-arm. If you feel that you can still fight and be supportive to the team, you have 40 S-8KOs and, if unlocked, the [[2A42 (30 mm)|30 mm 2A42]] cannon. \n\nThe S-8KO unguided rockets penetrate up to 420 mm of armour at a 0Â° angle. They are great for destroying light tanks and critically damaging MBTs from range. Up close, they destroy anything. Since the Ka-29 has access to the ballistic computer, this allows for great accuracy with both the rockets and the gun. As for the 7.62 mm GShG-7.62 minigun operated by the gunner, it is only really useful against helicopters you may encounter early game. As your degree of fire is limited with the GShG-7.62, helicopters are easier targets than fast-flying jets. Generally, it is recommended to leave destroying air targets to your teammates. The Ka-29 lacks effective air-to-air capabilities, though the 2A42 may be able to ward off any incoming jet aircraft eager to shoot you down. \n\nWith no RWR on board, it is advised to check each spawn for any SPAA that could be lying there. Going up high and attacking tanks from above, while still holding your altitude, is a great strategy, though it is imperative that you watch the skies for inbound enemy aircraft. If a MANPADs is spotted, using the 'Periodic countermeasure release' button can come in handy. As FIM-92 Stinger air-to-air missiles oftentimes prove to be invincible to countermeasures once in the air, so-called \"pre-flaring\" at the sight of a MANPADs vehicle using the periodic countermeasure release seems to be one of the only options to defend against these threats. There is a chance that the missile will go for your flares right off the launch, but this is not guaranteed to happen every time. Being very flare-resistant missiles, defense against MANPADs should be a top priority, alongside destroying enemy ground units.\n\nIn Ground Assault Arcade, the Ka-29 also functions well in its support role. The best loadout to take is the [[9M114 Shturm]] ATGMs and the [[S-8KO]] unguided rockets. In this mode, your munitions automatically reload once spent, allowing for more longevity on the battlefield.\n\nIn Helicopter EC, the gun shines in this mode in an air-to-air capability, though it is recommended that you watch your ammo. Bringing Shturms is a must if you would like to engage enemy helicopters outside 1km range. The S-8KOs are a comfortable platform in this mode, as you fire each one of them individually. Paired with the ballistic computer, the Ka-29 can rack up multiple ground kills.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as \"bad\", \"good\" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as \"inadequate\" and \"effective\".'' -->\n\n'''Pros:'''\n\n* Surprisingly nimble\n* Coaxial rotor design increases stability, especially in fast dives\n* Effective anti-tank capabilities\n* The [[2A42 (30 mm)|30 mm 2A42]] cannon is incredibly potent, especially with the 'Ground targets' belt\n* Large amount of countermeasures, including HIRSS and IRCM\n* Ballistic computer allows for precise shooting\n\n'''Cons:'''\n\n* Rotary machine gun is rifle-calibre, making it useless against heavy armour\n* Rotary machine gun has limited degrees of fire, making usage difficult\n* No air-to-air missiles, majorly vulnerable versus other aircraft and helicopters\n* Lacks thermal vision, can only use basic infrared image intensifiers\n* Low ammo count for the 30 mm, some trigger discipline is required\n* Lacks an RWR, making spotting ground-based air defences like SAMs and MANPADs difficult\n\n== History ==\n<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the helicopter in more detail than in the introduction.

Initially, the machine was to be designated Ka-252TB, but was later changed to Ka-29. The Ka-29 was intended to support amphibious naval operations by providing fire support for advancing troops.\n\nAfter some development work, the prototype of the Ka-29 was ready for testing and conducted its maiden flight in July 1976. Testing was successfully completed by 1979, with the Ka-29 entering mass production in 1984. Shortly after, the Ka-29 entered service with the Soviet Navy in 1985, serving aboard the newly commissioned Ivan Rogov-class landing ships.\n\nProduction of the Ka-29 lasted until 1988, with about 60 units of the type being built. This helicopter saw combat in Chechnya in 2000-2001, and a few units served in police special operations branches. The Ka-29 is still in service with Russian and foreign navies more than three decades after its initial introduction to service.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=ka_29 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Images\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"150\">\nFile:Ka-29 WTWallpaper 01.jpg|\nFile:Ka-29 WTWallpaper 02.jpg|\nFile:Ka-29 WTWallpaper 03.jpg|\nFile:Ka-29 WTWallpaper 04.jpg|\nFile:Ka-29 WTWallpaper 05.jpg|\nFile:Ka-29 WTWallpaper 06.jpg|\nFile:Ka-29 WTWallpaper 07.jpg|\n</gallery>\n\n== See also ==\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n\n* ''reference to the series of the helicopter;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wt:en/news/6612-development-kamov-ka-29-nimble-fatboy-en|[Devblog] Kamov Ka-29: Nimble Fatboy]]\n\n{{AirManufacturer Kamov}}\n{{USSR helicopters}}"}}
