It was introduced as a [[wt:en/news/5712-shop-pre-order-bundles-and-packs-for-major-update-1-81-en|premium pack]] in [[Update 1.81 \"The Valkyries\"]] and was removed from sale after the [[wt:en/news/6542-shop-the-new-year-sale-en|2019 New Year Sale]].\n\nOne of the most iconic helicopter gunships of the Cold War, the Mil Mi-24 was widely exported throughout the Eastern Bloc as the Soviet Union armed its satellites in Europe and abroad. This Mi-24D is one such example, and flies the colors of the Czechoslovak Air Force. The \"Hind\" is one of the most heavily armed gunships ever made, possessing extensive payloads and a durable airframe, at the cost of low manoeuvrability. A pair of Klimov TV3-117V turboshaft engines give the helicopter good lifting power and decent flight speeds.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Flight performance ===\n{{Specs-Heli-Flight}}\n<!-- ''Describe how the helicopter behaves in the air.

If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\n\nThe Mi-24D, is the equivalent of the ancient Rome's cataphractarii, it's heavily armoured, packs incredible firepower and well the Hinds are one of the scariest helicopters in the game. Whether it be Air or Ground attack or even in naval.\n\n===Air to Air===\n\n====Mi-24D Vs. Helicopters====\nThe Mi-24D is able to make quick work of enemy helicopters, with its 12.7 mm YaK-B rotary machine gun. To get the best bullet to knockout ratio - always aim for the critical elements of the rival.\n#Flight deck\n#Engine\n#Tail\nOr if you wish to play with the enemy helicopter, shoot it's wings off with a few well placed shots and it will lose all it's suspended armament. However, doing this will not knockout any machine guns or cannons which it has mounted below on the air frame.\nUsing the ATGM's to destroy enemy helicopters, the Falanga-PV are one of the fastest missiles in the game - they are able to destroy most helicopters with one hit - however helicopters such as [[Ka-52]], [[Mi-28N]] & [[EC-665_Tiger_HAD|Tiger HAD]] will need to hit the tail, flight deck or engine since they are heavily armoured.\n\nThe Mi-24D has 14 Suspended armament presets, from cannons to ATGM's combinations.\n\nThe recommended armaments for this role is:\n\n*64 x S-5K rockets + 4 x 9M17P Falanga-PV missiles + 2 x 23 mm GSh-23-2 cannons\n\nThe extra cannons installed on the wings, allows the Hind to perform the role of an attack helicopter - these cannons are able to destroy enemy helicopters, within a few clicks of the mouse. However, if this is used in an air to ground role these cannons can only penetrate lightly armoured vehicles.\n\nIf playing this in a Air to ground role it's best to go for the\n*128 x S-5K rockets + 4 x 9M17P Falanga-PV missiles\n\n====Mi-24D Vs. Fighters====\nThe Mi-24D does not have any air to air missiles, this means engagement with jet fighters will most likely end up with the Hind getting knocked out. However, it is not impossible to shoot them down. To do this, make sure you are equipped with the ATGM's. Wait for the aircraft to approach you head on and fire, keep the ATGM lined up with aircraft and a few seconds later it should hit.\n\nIf the aircraft has missiles, nose over the Mi-24D, gain speed, lots of speed - faster you can do this, higher the odds of the jet missing. Drop the Mi-24D to the ground and pull up after the jet has overshot you. If the jet banks and turns around, fire the ATGM and correct the ATGM so it hits the aircraft during this turn.\n\n===Air to Ground===\n\nThe best payload for combined battles is\n* 128 x S-5K rockets + 4 x 9M17P Falanga-PV missiles\nWhen enemy tankers see the Hind coming towards them, or see it flash up on the hud, they flea for cover. The Mi-24D, provides eight ATGM (Falanga-PV) missiles - these are enough to knockout eight enemy tanks, with a single hit. The range of the Falanga-PV missiles allow for strikes to happen at a distance, which keeps the helicopter out of range from most enemy SPAA or tanks.\n\n====Mi-24D Vs. SPAA====\nHowever the first target if seen, should always be enemy SPAA vehicles. Once the SPAA units have been located and knocked out, it is free hunting. The Mi-24D provides 128 S-5K rockets with its eight Falanga-PV missiles. These 128 rockets provide the capability for at least another two enemy tanks to be knocked out. With a skilled shot, it is EVEN possible that over four or five plus enemy tanks can be destroyed using them, on top of the eight ATGM's.\n\nThe Mi-24D is a very large helicopter, it's not a small sleek stealthy helicopter like the [[BO_105_(Family)|BO 105]] It is a big target - In-order to compensate, fly low and fast. Stay above the tree line, under 20 meters so any fussed missiles cannot detonate with their proximity fuses. Proximity fuses do not need to directly hit you, for them to knock you out, they only have to explode within the proximity of the helicopter.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as \"bad\", \"good\" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as \"inadequate\" and \"effective\".'' -->\n\n'''Pros:'''\n* Extensive payload options, including lethal S-24 rockets\n* Excellent ATGM penetration at 650mm\n* Well armoured against small arms fire\n* Quick-firing machine gun capable of shredding very light armour\n* Premium vehicle reward bonuses for RP and SL\n\n'''Cons:'''\n* No Air to Air missiles\n* Limited ATGM firing arcs at close ranges\n* Very visible, with large radar cross section\n* Sluggish to manoeuvre at most speeds\n* No thermal optics, only early NVG\n\n== History ==\n''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the helicopter in more detail than in the introduction.
