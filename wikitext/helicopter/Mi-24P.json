It was introduced in [[Update 1.81 \"The Valkyries\"]].\n\n== General info ==\n=== Flight performance ===\n{{Specs-Heli-Flight}}\n<!-- ''Describe how the helicopter behaves in the air.

The cockpit is protected by 60mm of bulletproof glass, though it's only on the front and the pilot can be knocked out easily with a spray of MG fire. Same can be applied to the gunner too. It can survive direct shots, especially if the enemy hits the crew compartment due to the empty space of that area, though there is fuel underneath the crew compartment and can be set on fire if it is hit. HE/HE-VT, ATGMs, SAMS and AAMs are usually detrimental to the Hind and can bring it down easily, though MANPADs such as Stingers and Iglas can be tanked as they have lower explosive power, but they can render the Hind critically damaged/disabled and needing to return to base.\n\n=== Modifications and economy ===\n{{Specs-Economy}}\n\n== Armaments ==\n{{Specs-Heli-Armaments}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\" | [[Ballistic Computer]]\n|-\n!

Several Soviet officers believed that conventional weapons were a safer choice to spend money in. But seeing the successful use of armed helicopters in Vietnam by the US Army convinced the Soviets about the capacities of armed helicopters, thus showing support for Mil's project.\n\nTwo prototypes were eventually created: a 7-ton single-engine design and a 10.5-ton twin-engined one. In May 1968, the twin-engine mock up was chosen for further development. The project made its first flight in September 1968, and entered service bearing the name of Mi-24 in 1972.\n\nThe Mi-24P variant was a later development of the Mi-24D, featuring a new fixed 30 mm twin-barrel GSh-30-2K cannon instead of the old 12.7 mm machine gun turret.\n\nThe helicopter first saw combat service in Ogaden War and in the Chadian-Libyan Conflict, used by the Ethiopian and Libyan forces respectively. The Mi-24 proved to be very effective in ground infantry support duties, even managing to save a company of infantry while out of ammunition, scaring the rebels by manoeuvring aggressively towards them! It was very popular among the ground troops.\n\nThe Mi-24P's modernized variant, the [[Mi-35M]], is still in use to this day in various countries, including Russia.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=mi_24p Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|lTR8bhL4BUc|'''The Mi-24 Family''' discusses the {{PAGENAME}} at 5:15 - ''War Thunder Official Channel''|6QZAY1EtkFU|'''The Shooting Range #110''' - ''Pages of History'' section at 10:26 discusses the {{PAGENAME}}.}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the helicopter;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n;Other Mi-24P variants\n* [[Mi-24P (Germany)]]\n* [[Mi-24P HFS 80 (Germany)]]\n\n== External links ==\n''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.''\n\n{{AirManufacturer Mil}}\n{{USSR helicopters}}"}}
