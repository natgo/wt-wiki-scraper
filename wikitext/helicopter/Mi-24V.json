This section may also include the vehicle's dev blog entry (if applicable) and the in-game encyclopedia description (under <code><nowiki>=== In-game description ===</nowiki></code>, also if applicable).'' -->\nWork on the Mi-24 began in the early 1960s, with engineers at the Mil design bureau coming to the realisation that helicopters capable of both transporting troops and materiel as well as being able to provide fire support are gaining ever-increasing importance with new combat doctrines focusing on battlefield mobility. The Mi-24V is a further development of the Mi-24, that entered production in 1976. The V modification most notably introduced the 9M114 \"Shturm\" guided missiles to the Hind's arsenal, which in turn significantly increased its hit probabilities and destructive power. In its decade-long production (1976 - 1984), around 1,000 Mi-24Vs were produced, eventually becoming the most produced version of the Hind.\n\n''- From [[wt:en/news/5709-development-mi-24-and-ah-1f-rotorcraft-icons-en|Devblog]]''\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=mi_24v Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Images\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Mi-24V WTWallpaper 001.jpg\nFile:Mi-24V WTWallpaper 002.jpg\nFile:Mi-24V WTWallpaper 003.jpg\nFile:Mi-24V WTWallpaper 004.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|lTR8bhL4BUc|'''The Mi-24 Family''' discusses the {{PAGENAME}} at 4:42 - ''War Thunder Official Channel''|6QZAY1EtkFU|'''The Shooting Range #110''' - ''Pages of History'' section at 10:26 discusses the {{PAGENAME}}.}}\n\n== See also ==\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n\n* ''reference to the series of the helicopter;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wt:en/news/5709-development-mi-24-and-ah-1f-rotorcraft-icons-en|[Devblog] Mi-24 and AH-1F: Rotorcraft Icons]]\n\n{{AirManufacturer Mil}}\n{{USSR helicopters}}"}}
