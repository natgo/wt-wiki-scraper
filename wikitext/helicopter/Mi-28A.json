In the second part, tell the reader about the helicopter in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a premium rank {{Specs|rank}} Swedish attack helicopter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update \"Wind of Change\"]].\n\nBased on the early production Mi-28A that was trialed by the Swedish army during the 1990s, its loadouts and gunnery equipment are somewhat limited in comparison to the later [[Mi-28N]] and [[Mi-28N]], but remains very potent in the right hands.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Flight performance ===\n{{Specs-Heli-Flight}}\n<!-- ''Describe how the helicopter behaves in the air.

On the sides they are protected by thin armour plating together with some ceramic on both sides. An additional armour plating is located at the bottom protecting the crew from any minor shrapnel. Everything is surrounded by a small steel cage around the cockpit. Only the crew are protected and the engine and fuel tanks are left exposed. \n\n* 42 mm (56-59Â°) Bulletproof glass - Frontal windshield\n* 22 mm Bulletproof glass - Side windshield\n* 10 mm Aluminium alloy - Cockpit front, middle, rear and bottom\n* 10 mm Aluminium alloy - Cockpit sides and doors\n* 16 mm Ceramic - Cockpit sides\n* 8 mm Steel - Canopy framing\n\n=== Modifications and economy ===\n{{Specs-Economy}}\n\n== Armaments ==\n{{Specs-Heli-Armaments}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\" | [[Ballistic Computer]]\n|-\n!

Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as \"bad\", \"good\" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as \"inadequate\" and \"effective\".'' -->\n\n'''Pros:'''\n\n* A highly armored and well-protected helicopter, the Mi-28A can handle surprising amounts of enemy fire before succumbing to damage\n* Access to the very good 9M120 missiles, allowing for long-range one-hit attacks on enemy ground targets\n** 9M120 missiles are also usable against air targets with some practice\n* 30 mm 2A42 nose gun is very useful vs both air and ground targets - APDS belt is highly effective against SPAAs, light tanks, and tank destroyers\n** The gun, being nose-mounted, has a very large cone of movement, making it more useful than the semi-fixed one of the [[Ka-50]] and [[Ka-52]]\n* Access to both S-8KO HEAT and S-13OF HEF rockets - the latter are extremely capable in the right hands\n* CCIP for all weaponry, allowing both 3rd and 1st person targetting with ease!\n* Access to a good amount of flare and chaff to protect against AAMs and SAMs\n\n'''Cons:'''\n\n* The Mi-28A is a very large and relatively helicopter - it is by no means agile, and it needs to be flown carefully, as hard maneuvers at low altitude may very well lead to a crash\n* No access to night vision or thermal imaging for the gunner position, meaning night maps are potentially difficult to navigate, and targetting is near impossible\n* No IRCM or MAW system, meaning missile avoidance using countermeasures is entirely manual and dependent on being aware of surroundings\n* The engine area is unprotected - even HMG or autocannon fire can damage the engines, transmission, and radiators, leading to severely reduced flight performance, or an unsurvivable loss of thrust\n* Its well-known silhouette and its reputation means the Mi-28A will often be targeted by enemy SPAA and airplanes with high priority \n\n== History ==\n<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the helicopter in more detail than in the introduction.
