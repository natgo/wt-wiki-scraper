In the second part, tell the reader about the helicopter in the game. Insert a screenshot of the vehicle, so that if the novice player does not remember the vehicle by name, he will immediately understand what kind of vehicle the article is talking about.'' -->\nThe '''{{Specs|name}}''' is a rank {{Specs|rank}} Soviet attack helicopter {{Battle-rating}}. It was introduced in [[Update \"Ground Breaking\"]]. Also known as 'Havoc', it is the successor of the legendary [[Mi-24 (Family)|Mi-24 Hind]] in the gunship role, featuring much better combat systems for the task. It is an upgrade of the previous [[Mi-28N]] with better weapon systems, enhanced NVD and a surface-search radar.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Flight performance ===\n{{Specs-Heli-Flight}}\n<!-- ''Describe how the helicopter behaves in the air. Speed, manoeuvrability, acceleration and allowable loads - these are the most important characteristics of the vehicle.'' -->\nThe Mi-28NM is not so different when it comes to flight performance compared to his predecessors. It can reach high speeds with ease but severely lacks manoeuvrability and agility compared to its counterparts, particularly the EC-665 Tiger family. While it is able to quickly reach fast speeds, the Mi-28 also takes time to slow down, forcing pilots to estimate the braking distance to avoid enemy fire or crashing.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Characteristics\n! colspan=\"2\" | Max Speed<br>(km/h at 1,000 m)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Max altitude<br>(metres)\n|-\n!

Note how vulnerable the structure is and how secure the pilot is, whether the fuel tanks are armoured, etc. Describe the armour, if there is any, and also mention the vulnerability of other critical systems.'' -->\nThe Mi-28NM has an armoured cabin that protects all flanks of both the pilot and the gunner from small arms fire and fragmentation. It is one of the strongest armoured helicopter cabins in the game, making it able to withstand multiple hits from small machine guns. However, armour is inefficient when facing heavy calibre anti-air such as 12.7 mm machine gun fire and higher calibre autocannons; missiles are not excluded. The Mi-28NM also has access to a high quantity of countermeasures, nothing new in Russian helicopters. It has access to 128 countermeasures that are coupled to the Missile Alert Warning system. They are particularly useful when facing IR guided missiles from various threats. Carrying chaff in these pods can also be useful, although its effectiveness may be limited due to the resistance of radars to interference at this rank. However, it is also able to be used when facing SARH and ARH missiles such as the AIM-7 Sparrow and AIM-54 Phoenix. As with all helicopters, the best armour is to remain hidden and at stand-off distance, using buildings or environmental cover to protect you from radars, IRST and visual contact which will then escalate to engagement.\n\n=== Modifications and economy ===\n{{Specs-Economy}}\n\nIt is recommended that the ATGMs are prioritized, followed by NVD and finally countermeasures. The initial Ataka missiles are useful as starter missiles but later missiles should be prioritized, especially the Vikhr ATGM. As one continues to research, protection modules are advised such as flak jacket. Flight performance modules are suggested but not a 'must have'.\n\n== Armaments ==\n{{Specs-Heli-Armaments}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\" | [[Ballistic Computer]]\n|-\n!

While Vikhrs may seem the most obvious decision of missile to carry, the Ataka and Khrizantema missiles can also be useful in certain situations. Khrizantema holds the highest penetration and the highest explosive payload at the same range of the Ataka (but almost half of the range of the Vikhr), at the cost of a reduced numbers able to be carried. Vikhr holds the highest speed and range with a bigger explosive payload than Ataka but smaller than Khrizantema, it also has a proximity fuze. Depending on the needs, the missiles to be carried are set to user's discretion.\n\nThe Mi-28NM also has access to Igla missiles, carrying the highest amount of anti-air missiles in-game (up to 8), making the Mi-28N a formidable anti-air platform. It should be noted that the Vikhr can also be used for the anti-air role, but require the constant attention of the user instead of being fire-and-forget like the Igla.\n\n== Usage in battles ==\n<!-- ''Describe the tactics of playing in a helicopter, the features of using the helicopter in a team and advice on tactics. Refrain from creating a \"guide\" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\nThe Mi-28NM is a gunship and should be used as such. It holds a very capable array of weapons for all scenarios: from column destroying to anti-ship duties. The primary role of the Mi-28NM is Close Air Support, making it a very capable platform for assisting ground allies against other ground assets with rockets and missiles. However, it can be used primarily in three ways:\n\n* Anti-tank role: due to the significant amount of ATGMs it can carry, the Mi-28NM is more than suited for tank busting at all ranges in all weathers. Trees, buildings, and other environmental cover should be used to ensure the survivability of the Havoc as it will protect it from detection and, in case of being spotted and engaged, a route of escape as well as solid cover against enemy missiles and anti-air cannons.\n* Rocket launcher: the immense quantities of rockets it can carry make it a flying MLRS, able to strafe all sorts of ground targets with the vast selection of rockets. S-8KO rockets prove to be the best for taking out both armoured targets and lightly armoured but scattered targets, as the penetration and quantities of the rockets ensure you are able to cover a wider area with salvos. The S-13OF rockets are more of a heavy duty rocket where a lot of explosive power needs to be centralized in a single place, for example when taking down enemy bases and control points in Helicopter Enduring Confrontation mode.\n* Anti-air: not only do the Vikhrs prove themselves to be a formidable anti-air weapon, but the vast amount of Iglas show that the Mi-28NM is very much capable of taking care of the airspace, as it can take a maximum of 8 targets almost simultaneously. The best way to approach this role is to stay behind cover, out of sight and engage only when an enemy aircraft is spotted, being helicopter or jet. One of the main disadvantages of facing helicopters with the Igla is that most will have MAW at top tier, which will automatically pop flares and confuse the Igla; for this reason, unsuspecting opponents should be targeted, and if possible, be strafed with the autocannon.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as \"bad\", \"good\" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as \"inadequate\" and \"effective\".'' -->\n\n'''Pros:'''\n\n* High speed\n* Wide variety of weaponry\n* Access to gunner thermals and surface-search radar\n* Gimbal 30 mm autocannon\n* Strong cabin armour\n\n'''Cons:'''\n\n* Sluggish and tanky\n* Retains too much energy at speeds\n* Triggers RWR from other aircraft and helicopters\n\n== History ==\n<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the helicopter in more detail than in the introduction.
