While playing the distance game, it is important to make sure the chopper does not stay stationary when picking out and shooting at targets or else the {{PAGENAME}} will become an easy target.

At the moment, the Mi-35M is the most modern modification of the Mi-24 series. During its versatile service in Afghanistan, India, and other locations, the \"Hind\" performed well but had few vital flaws. A modernized version, titled Mi-35, underwent specific improvements. The helicopter gained new more powerful engines, the metal rotor was replaced by a composite one,  the 3-bladed anti-torque rotor was replaced by an X-shaped composite one. The Mi-35M was given fixed landing gear and new shorter wings with only four weaponry mounting points. The weapon itself has also been updated: A 4-barreled 50.cal machine gun in the chin-mounted rotating turret is now replaced by a twin-barreled 23-mm GSh-23L autocannon. Mounted weaponry now consists of two types of ATGMs, modern air-to-ground unguided rockets, 23mm cannon pods, and other changes. The Mi-35M is currently in service in the Russian Air Forces, and other nations. Russian and Iraqi Mi-35M-s fought in recent actions in Syria.\n\n''- From [[wt:en/news/5751-development-mi-35m-up-to-date-hind-en|Devblog]]''\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=mi_35m Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Images\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Mi-35M WTWallpaper001.jpg\nFile:Mi-35M WTWallpaper002.jpg\nFile:Mi-35M WTWallpaper003.jpg\nFile:Mi-35M WTWallpaper004.jpg\nFile:Mi-35M WTWallpaper005.jpg\nFile:Mi-35M WTWallpaper006.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|lTR8bhL4BUc|'''The Mi-24 Family''' discusses the {{PAGENAME}} at 6:25 - ''War Thunder Official Channel''|W6WWooehhFw|'''The Shooting Range #145''' - ''Metal Beasts'' section at 00:32 discusses the {{PAGENAME}}.|hNnQ8_7BfP4|'''AH-1Z vs {{PAGENAME}}''' - ''War Thunder Official Channel''}}\n\n== See also ==\n''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n\n* ''reference to the series of the helicopter;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.''\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wt:en/news/5751-development-mi-35m-up-to-date-hind-en|[Devblog] Mi-35M: Up-to-date \"Hind\"]]\n\n{{AirManufacturer Mil}}\n{{USSR helicopters}}"}}
