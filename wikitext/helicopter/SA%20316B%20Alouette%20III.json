Developed by Sud-Aviation and later built by Aerospatiale, the larger SA.316A took its maiden flight on February 28, 1959, with production following in 1961. Production of the initial variant lasted until 1968 when it was eventually replaced by the SA.316B model. Powered by the Turbomeca Artouste IIIB outputting 570 HP, the Alouette III has incredible power at high altitudes, and has been an invaluable asset in militaries as a light-transport helicopter as well as search & rescue services throughout the world. With its larger size and excellent all-around visibility from the enclosed, rounded glass cockpit as well as the more powerful engine it proved invaluable as a light-attack helicopter as well. Some mission-specific armament can include mounting of a 7.62 mm machine gun on a tripod fitted to the right-side doorway, 20 mm cannon affixed to the left side as well as 2-4 AS.11 anti-tank missiles or 2 Mk.44 torpedoes as required.\n\nThe SA.316B was produced in France from 1961 until 1985 when French factories were shut down, although production continues as of 2021 by Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) as the Chetak, extending the service life of the Alouette III in multiple militaries well into the future with new parts continuing to be manufactured under the HAL name. Many air forces over the years have claimed usefulness of the SA.316B including France, Argentina, India, and Austria, including some former operators are South Vietnam, Yugoslavia, and Upper Volta to name a few. Notably, Argentina was seen using them in the Falklands war in 1982, with one having been present on the deck of the ARA General Belgrano (formerly the USS Phoenix (CL-46) in US Navy service) during her sinking at the hands of the HMS Conqueror (S48) Churchill-class nuclear submarine. Although it has been retired in service with France, the helicopter is still seen flying in militaries around the world, and will continue to be seen well into 2022 and beyond providing light-attack as well as transport roles whenever needed.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=sa_316b Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Images\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:SA 316 WTWallpaper 002.jpg\nFile:SA 316 WTWallpaper 007.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n;Videos\n{{Youtube-gallery|2RX3Y1-HJHE|'''The Shooting Range #142''' - ''Pages of History'' section at 04:25 discusses the SUD Aviation Alouette.}}\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the helicopter;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n* [[IAR 316B]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wt:en/news/6062-development-sa-316b-alouette-iii-the-high-flying-skylark-en|[Devblog] SA.316B Alouette III: The High-Flying Skylark]]\n* [https://www.militaryfactory.com/aircraft/detail.asp?aircraft_id=348 <nowiki>[Military Factory]</nowiki> Aerospatiale Alouette III]\n\n{{AirManufacturer Aerospatiale}}\n{{France helicopters}}"}}
