It was introduced in [[Update 1.87 \"Locked On\"]].\n\nInitially designed by Sud Aviation in 1966, the Gazelle helicopter project (SA.340, SA.341 and SA.342) was continued by AÃ©rospatiale as a French five-seat transport, scout and light attack helicopter manufactured in both France and the United Kingdom. Manufacturing licenses were granted allowing a Yugoslavian company SOKO and the Arab British Helicopter Company in Egypt to also produce these aircraft.\n\nThe Turbomeca Artouste Astazou IIB turbine engine powers the Gazelle. Initial testing of this helicopter utilised a standard tail-rotor taken from the Alouette, however, design changes switched to a Fenestron-style tail, the first helicopter to do so. The Fenestron tail or \"fantail\" differs from a conventional tail rotor as it contains eight to eighteen blades housed within the tail unit of the helicopter. Advantages of the Fenestron include substantial noise reduction, protection of tail rotor damage from contact with other objects and protection of ground personnel working around the tail section. With the aid of the Fenestron tail, the Gazelle was the world's fastest helicopter in its class during its early years.\n\nIn the service of the French, the Gazelle SA.341F was utilised as a light support helicopter equipped with a 20 mm GLAT M.261 cannon and various rockets, anti-tank missiles and air-to-air missiles. Over the years, the Gazelle was removed from anti-tank duty and reconfigured for operations as an Air Observation Post directing artillery fire, airborne forward air controller directing ground-attack troops, troop casualty evacuations and communication relay operations.\n\n== General info ==\n=== Flight performance ===\n{{Specs-Heli-Flight}}\n<!-- ''Describe how the helicopter behaves in the air.

Refrain from creating a \"guide\" - do not impose a single point of view, but instead, give the reader food for thought. Examine the most dangerous enemies and give recommendations on fighting them. If necessary, note the specifics of the game in different modes (AB, RB, SB).'' -->\nThis helicopter has three main playstyles, centred around the selected loadout.\n\n* Anti-Tank: Using ATGMs, get within 4 km of a target, while remaining hidden by trees or buildings, and guide your missile to the target. Focus on tanks without reactive armour, as they may render your missiles ineffective, and waste your time. After expending your missiles, it is best to return to the helipad and resupply.\n\n* Rocketeer: Using unguided rockets, fly low over the battlefield and assault a single tank with a precise salvo, and then retreat behind cover.\n\n* Air defence: Using AAMs, sneak behind enemy lines, and land in an obscured area, or behind cover, and wait for aircraft or helicopters to get near your allies. Then surprise attack them with your missiles and cannon fire. This will make short work of any helicopter, and most slow-flying aircraft.\n\nOverall you want to avoid direct line-of-sight to your enemies, as they likely can spot you faster than you can spot them, and engage you at longer range. Surface-to-air missiles are a serious threat, as they can take you by surprise, and you have no radar detector to warn you of their presence. The same applies to radar-guided anti-aircraft guns.\n\nIn Helicopter Battles [PvE] the Gazelle is notably better than either of the two preceding helicopters, finally unlocking AAMs with a greater range (5.5km) than 3/4km ATGMs. However, due to the limited armament (2 missiles), the Gazelle is limited to strafing ground targets and trying to lock onto enemy planes.\n\n'''Notable Enemies:'''\n\n* [[Mi-28N]], [[Mi-24P]], [[Mi-24V]]: Due to the gazelle's lack of a MAW system, it is still possible to shoot it down with the AAMs these helicopters carry. Their Armor also means that it is harder for you to shoot them down in return.\n* [[Ka-50]], [[Ka-52]]: Both can outrange you, meaning that killing one is the result of their mistakes\n* [[EC-665 Tiger UHT]]: Similar to the [[Ka-50]], the Tiger has access to IR-guided ATGMS with long range.\n* [[AH-1 (Family)|AH-1]]: Highly manoeuvrable with a high volume of fire, the Cobra family of helicopters is incredibly good at dogfighting. Engage from long range, or use superior speed to flee.\n\n=== Pros and cons ===\n<!-- ''Summarise and briefly evaluate the vehicle in terms of its characteristics and combat effectiveness. Mark its pros and cons in the bulleted list. Try not to use more than 6 points for each of the characteristics. Avoid using categorical definitions such as \"bad\", \"good\" and the like - use substitutions with softer forms such as \"inadequate\" and \"effective\".'' -->\n\n'''Pros:'''\n\n* One of the smallest helicopters, easier to hide, and harder to hit at high speed\n* 20 mm autocannon for engaging aircraft and lightly-armoured vehicles\n* Respectable ammo count for the cannon\n* Mistral air-to-air missiles\n* Has access to flares and night vision optics\n* Can be equipped with HOT-1 and HOT-2 AGMs\n\n'''Cons:'''\n\n* Surprisingly hard to manoeuvre at speed, and has a tendency to over-roll\n* No armour, easy to damage critical components and eliminate crew\n* No thermal sights\n* Starts off with one of the weakest stock loadouts for helicopters\n* Fixed forward cannon is hard to get on target\n* Very low unguided rocket count\n* High aim angle for rockets, the crosshair get out of screen when zoomed\n* Can only equip one type of missile at a time; AGM or AAM\n* Carries only two of each missile\n\n== History ==\n<!-- ''Describe the history of the creation and combat usage of the helicopter in more detail than in the introduction.

Aerospatiale designated the project as X 300, but the prototype's designation was SA.340.\n\nThe prototype first flew in 1967, and it seemed outwardly similar to the Aloette II. It did use the Astazou II powerplant and transmission system, but there were a number of differences. For one thing, it introduced a fully enclosed fuselage and a cockpit with seating and controls for two pilots rather than one (although it could be flown by only one). Also introduced on the SA.340 were the fenestron - a shrouded tail rotor - and the Bolkow-type main rotor.\n\nThe British became interested in the project as the SA.340 was nearing completion, so a joint development and production sharing agreement was signed on 22 February 1967; it was officially confirmed in 1968. The first prototype (SA.340.001) flew for the first time on 7 April 1967, and the second prototype first flew in April 1968.\n\nFour pre-production aircraft, redesignated as the SA.341, were built next. The third pre-production SA.341 was built to British Army requirements and was then shipped to Britain for testing as the AH.Mk.1. Notably, the first pre-production SA.341 established three new speed records for helicopters of its class on 14 May 1970.\n\nOn 6 August 1971, the first French production SA.341 (SA.341.1001) was cleared for test flights. The production version had a longer fuselage, a larger tail, and a more powerful Astazou IIIA engine.\n\nThe SA.341F Gazelle was a French Military light support version of the SA.341 Gazelle, which had the improved Astazou IIIC engine. 166 were produced, and many were armed with a GIAT 20 mm M.621 cannon in a nose turret. They could be armed with rocket pods, Euromissile HOT anti-tank guided missiles (ATGMs), or Mistral air-to-air missiles (AAMs). A number of SA.341F Gazelles remain in service with the ALAT.\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=sa_341f Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n;Images\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:SA 341F WTWallpaper 001.jpg\nFile:SA 341F WTWallpaper 002.jpg\nFile:SA 341F WTWallpaper 003.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the helicopter;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n;Related development\n* [[SA 342M Gazelle]]\n\n;Other vehicles of similar configuration and role\n* [[BO 105 (Family)]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wt:en/news/6057-development-sa-341f-sa-342m-gazelle-light-hunter-en|[Development] SA.341F & SA.342M Gazelle: Light Hunter]]\n\n{{AirManufacturer Aerospatiale}}\n{{France helicopters}}"}}
