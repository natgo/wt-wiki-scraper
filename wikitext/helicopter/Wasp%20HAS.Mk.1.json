Initially designed as a torpedo-carrying light patrol and scout helicopter, the Wasp was later modified to be able to carry the SS.11 (AGM-22) wire-guided missile. It gained the distinction of sinking a ship in combat, the ARA ''Santa Fe'', which was sunk using AGM-22s and torpedoes during the Falklands War. The Wasp has been used by the militaries of several nations, but has now been retired and replaced with more modern helicopters.<ref name=\":0\">Navy Wings. (2019)</ref>\n\n=== Design and Development ===\nThe Westland Wasp originated from a requirement for a new shipborne helicopter that was both small but could also carry two homing torpedoes - this was known as the MATCH (Manned Torpedo-Carrying Helicopter) program.<ref name=\":0\" /> The Wasp was designed to operate in conjunction with its mothership, dropping its load of torpedoes on enemy submarines as directed by the mothership's sonar.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe Westland design firm decided to design a new helicopter based on their successful Westland Scout design.<ref name=\":0\" /> The original skid-type landing gear was replaced with a quad-set of wheels, while the rotors and fuselage were designed to be fully foldable to make the helicopter as compact as possible.<ref name=\":0\" /> As well, the Wasp wasn't fitted with mounted machine guns, as they were deemed unnecessary for the anti-submarine warfare role. The first pre-production Westland Wasp flew on October 28th 1962.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Operational History ===\n[[File:Brazilian Westland Wasp over USS Mahan (DDG-42) 1977.jpg|thumb|A Brazilian Wasp hovers off USS Mahan, 1977.]]\nFollowing the end of testing, the Royal Navy ordered a total of 133 Westland Wasps. These aircraft served on a variety of RN ships, where they distinguished themselves as reliable search, rescue and anti submarine warfare helicopters.<ref name=\":0\" /> Later on, the Wasp was given the ability to carry four AGM-22 missiles, which were license-produced variants of the SS.11 anti-tank missile developed by Nord Aviation.\n\nThe Westland Wasp had its largest success in 1982, when it engaged the Argentinian submarine ARA ''Santa Fe''.<ref name=\":0\" /> After a Westland Wessex helicopter managed to spot the submarine, three Royal Navy Wasps managed to fire several AS.12 (an anti-ship variant of the SS.11) missiles at the submarine, scoring hits. The damage suffered was enough to prompt the Argentinian crew to abandon the submarine, which was claimed by British forces and scuttled. The Wasp enjoyed a long service life, being retired in 1988 after the last Type 12 Rothesay-class frigates were decommissioned.<ref name=\":0\" /> It was also exported to several other nations, and was used by the Royal Malaysian Navy until 2000. A total of 133 Wasps were built.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Media ==\n<!-- ''Excellent additions to the article would be video guides, screenshots from the game, and photos.'' -->\n\n;Skins\n* [https://live.warthunder.com/feed/camouflages/?vehicle=wasp_has_mk1 Skins and camouflages for the {{PAGENAME}} from live.warthunder.com.]\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- ''Links to the articles on the War Thunder Wiki that you think will be useful for the reader, for example:''\n* ''reference to the series of the helicopter;''\n* ''links to approximate analogues of other nations and research trees.'' -->\n\n* [[Scout AH.Mk.1]]\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ''Paste links to sources and external resources, such as:''\n* ''topic on the official game forum;''\n* ''other literature.'' -->\n\n* [[wt:en/news/6318-development-westland-scout-wasp-sting-like-a-bee-en|[Development] Westland Scout & Wasp: Sting Like A Bee]]\n\n=== References ===\n;Citations\n<references />\n\n;Bibliography\n* Navy Wings.
